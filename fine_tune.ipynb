      "NUM  ms vibha datta makhija learned counsel appearing on behalf of the state on the other hand would support the judgment of the high court inter alia contending that whereas the judgment of the learned sessions judge was based on surmises and conjectures the high court assigned sufficient and cogent reasons for arriving at its findings it was pointed out that in a case like the present one the court should consider the matter having regard to three scenarios in mind viz\n",
      "i suicide committed by bimlabai\n",
      "ii murder by intruder and\n",
      "iii murder by the accused and arriving at a finding upon excluding the one or the other possibility\n",
      "NUM  the learned counsel would contend that the deceased was a young girl and in view of the fact that she must have been having the same state of mind for more than a year and thus she was unlikely to commit suicide only because she was not sent by her inlaws to attend the marriage of her brother in any event having regard to the presence of ligature mark on her neck commission of suicide by self strangulation and thereafter setting herself on fire must be ruled out\n",
      "NUM  the learned counsel would contend that commission of murder of bimlabai by an intruder is wholly improbable it was pointed out that pwNUM pwNUM cwNUM and cwNUM categorically stated that the appellant no NUM was at home at about NUM pm the learned counsel would contend that if the appellants and kusum were present in the house and if the story that immediately prior to the occurrence the family was visited by pwNUM it is impossible for an intruder to come and commit the offence without being noticed the learned counsel would aruge that such an offence is not possible to be committed without drawing the attention of others without any noise and without any shriek by the victim which are clear pointers to the fact that throttling of the deceased must have been committed by somebody who was known to her and had access and in that view of the matter the offender cannot be any other person but the appellant no NUM\n",
      "NUM  ms makhija would contend that demand of dowry an unhappy marriage the threat by the appellant no NUM and his father and pwNUMs refusal to give to the accused person the sum of rs NUM on demanded by them establish sufficient motive for the accused persons to commit the murder of bimlabai and then to make the same look like a case of suicide the burn injuries suffered by the appellant no NUM in hand is also a pointer to the fact ms makhija would contend that she had also taken part in setting fire on the deceased\n",
      "NUM  it was urged that as the plea of alibi of the appellants have not been proved and keeping in view the proximity of time and the place of occurrence and time of murder it can safely be presumed that the entire occurrence took place within NUM minutes and it was possible for the appellant no NUM to come back from the house of illias khan and upon commission of the crime go back to his house to show his absence furthermore the burden of proof when a plea of alibi has been found to be false lies upon the accused persons ms makhija would argue\n",
      "NUM  it is a case which in our considered opinion requires a broad based consideration\n",
      "NUM  we will proceed on the basis that the death of bimlabai was a homicidal one we will also assume that the contents of the post mortem report is correct and thus the death of bimlabai was caused due to asphyxia we may further assume that the appellants herein have failed to prove their plea of alibi what however is baffling to us on the manner in which the offence is alleged to have been committed the high court arrived at its findings relying upon the spot map prepared by learned trial judge which indicates that there existed a window in the kitchen without any grill the height whereof from the road is said to be NUM ft holding \n",
      "NUM from the map proved by the prosecution the site map and the note prepared on the direction of the judge go to show that there were two places wherefrom a person in the kitchen and the side room of kitchen could slip away i by window which is nearly NUM to NUM feet in height from the ground it is note worthy that it is not a construction with plain wall upto NUM feet but with residential quarters in the ground floor and therefore it was not impossible to slip away from that window after commission of murder and ii the other possibility that the person who committed murder came out from the gap between the wall containing door no NUM and NUM and the roof which was probably closed subsequently and therefore marks of new constructions of the wall above the door upto roof\n",
      "NUM  the high court therefore considered the escape of the assassin of bimlabai through one of the two gaps as possible but did not assign any reason as to how the same can be said to have been established furthermore it does not appear that such a case was made out by the prosecution investigation in this behalf does not appear to have been carried out to show as to whether it was possible for a person to climb the wall before slipping out of one of the two places mentioned by the high court nor any material in support thereof was brought on record the witnesses did not say that they had seen any foot mark of any person on the wall nor any other evidence suggests that one of the two open places would otherwise be used by the offender as possible escape routes if the time of incident is taken to be nearer NUM pm than NUM pm it would be well nigh possible for the appellant no NUM to climb the wall sneak through the open places and jump from the window to the lane without being noticed it also does not appear that the attention of the appellants had been drawn by the sessions judge to any piece of evidence seeking their explanation thereabout in their examination under section NUM of the code of criminal procedure had it been the prosecution case that the appellant no NUM after throttling the deceased and setting her on fire escaped through one of the two open places mentioned by the high court it was obligatory on the part of the court to give an opportunity to the appellants to explain thereabout such a circumstance had it been put to the appellant noNUM could have been explained away by him the appellants were therefore prejudiced by not being given a chance to explain the said purported material against him it is not a case where no prejudice can be said to have been caused to the appellants\n",
      "NUM  the findings of the learned sessions judge to the effect that had any person slipped or gone away from that window pedestrians through the lanes must have seen such person cannot in our opinion be said to be irrational warranting interference by the high court if the observations of the high court to the effect that persons going through the road do not keep a vigil on such movements is correct the same by would itself give rise to some surmises keeping in view the fact that there existed a greater possibility of the appellant noNUM being seen as his jumping from the window would have been abnormal which would attract the attention of the persons who had assembled to take water from the tap we also fail to see any force in the finding of the high court to the effect that only because the appellant noNUM was the husband of the deceased he had a chance to throttle her all of a sudden without any resistance the finding of the high court to the effect that gulbadanbai having sustained burn injuries in her hand the probability of her presence at this time of setting of fire cannot be ruled out is contradictory to its ultimate finding that she was guilty of offence only under section NUM of the indian penal code and not under section NUM thereof\n",
      "NUM  it is now wellsettled that benefit of doubt belonged to the accused it is further trite that suspicion however grave may be cannot take place of a proof it is equally wellsettled that there is a long distance between may be and must be\n",
      "NUM  it is also wellknown that even in a case where a plea of alibi is raised the burden of proof remains on prosecution presumption of innocence is a human right such presumption gets stronger when a judgment of acquittal is passed this court in a number of decisions has set out the legal principle for reversing the judgment of acquittal by a higher court see dhanna vs state of mp NUM NUM scc NUM NUM indlaw sc NUM mahabir singh vs state of haryana NUM NUM scc NUM NUM indlaw sc NUM and shailendra pratap  anr vs state of up NUM NUM scc NUM NUM indlaw sc NUM which had not been adhered to by the high court\n",
      "NUM  the entire case is based on circumstantial evidence pieces of circumstances however strong may be it is well known that all links in the chain must be proved in this case a vital link in the chain viz possibility of the appellant no NUM committing the offence closing the door and then sneaking out of the room from one of the two places had not been proved by the prosecution\n",
      "NUM  we thus having regard to the post mortem report are of the opinion that the cause of death of bimlabai although is shrouded in mystery but benefit thereof must go to the appellants as in the event of there being two possible views the one supporting the accused should be upheld\n",
      "NUM  for the reasons aforementioned we are of the opinion that the impugned judgment cannot be sustained which is set aside accordingly the appeal is allowed the appellants are on bail they are discharged from the bail bonds\n",

      "NUM learned counsel argued that the aforesaid provision is in two parts one applies to persons with disability and the second party applies to persons with disability who require assistant devices or aids it was argued that the proviso applies to the latter category only whereas jeeja ghosh is merely a person with cerebral palsy and did not require any assistant device or aid the only assistance she required was regarding her baggage which she asked for at the time of security checkin thus there was no reason as to why she was asked to deboard the aircraft when there was no assistant device or aids about which she ought to have informed the airlines it is claimed that so far as requirement of assistance regarding baggage is concerned she had duly informed the officials of the airlines refuting the argument of learned counsel appearing for respondent noNUM predicated on rules NUM and NUM of the rules NUM it was submitted that the operations manual of the airline places an obligation on the pilot incharge not to commence the flight until heshe is sure of the safety of all the passengers in the present case there was no evidence to prove that jeeja ghosh had posed any hazard to the safety of the pilot incharge or other passengers moreover the decision to deboard her was taken without even interacting with her the claim of respondent noNUM that blood and froth was oozing out of the sides of her mouth is denied with the submission that there is no evidence to prove the same on the contrary it is claimed she was completely fine and it was only the conduct of the respondent airline which became a cause of her subsequent sickness referring to the offer given by the airline to fly jeeja ghosh on the very next day it is submitted that this act on the part of the airlines itself shows that jeeja ghosh was alright and there was no medical condition which would have been prevented her from flying mocking the stand of the airline that the person having cerebral palsy would in emergency situation not be able to respond to the safety instructions and she is a risk to herself and potential danger to the lives of copassengers also the submission of the petitioners is that it is in complete contravention of car NUM which prohibits the airlines from refusing to carry a person with disability or person with reduced mobility the relevant provisions in this regard have already been extracted above\n",

      "NUM it is not in dispute that the pilot as well as the crew members of the airlines are supposed to ensure the safety of all the passengers and a decision can be taken to deboard a particular passenger in the larger interest and safety of other co passengers the question is whether such a situation existed when jeeja ghosh was deboarded whether this decision was taken by the airlines after taking due deliberations and with medical advise unfortunately the answer is a big no jeeja ghosh is a disabled person who suffers from cerebral palsy but her condition was not such which required any assistive devices or aids she had demanded assistance regarding her baggage at the time of security checkin from the checkin counter for boarding of the aircraft she came of her own this was noticed not only by the persons at the checkin counter but also by security personnel who frisked her and the attendant who assisted her in carrying her baggage up to the aircraft even if we assume that there was some blood or froth that was noticed to be oozing out from the sides of her mouth when she was seated in the aircraft though vehemently denied by her nobody even cared to interact with her and asked her the reason for the same no doctor was summoned to examine her condition abruptly and without any justification decision was taken to deboard her without ascertaining as to whether her condition was such which prevented her from flying this clearly amounts to violation of rule NUMa of rules NUM and the car NUM guidelines\n",

      "NUM all the three goals of human dignity as a constitutional value are expanded by the author in a scholarly manner some of the excerpts thereof are reproduced below which give a glimpse of these goals\n",
      "the first role of human dignity as a constitutional value is expressed in the approach that it comprises the foundation for all of the constitutional rights human dignity is the central argument for the existence of human rights it is the rationale for them all it is the justification for the existence of rights according to christoph enders it is the constitutional value that determines that every person has the right to have rights\n",
      "the second role of human dignity as a constitutional value is to provide meaning to the norms of the legal system according to purposive interpretation all of the provisions of the constitution and particularly all of the rights in the constitutional bill of rights are interpreted in light of human dignity\n",
      "lastly human dignity as a constitutional value influences the development of the common law indeed where common law is recognized judges have the duty to develop it and if necessary modify it so that it expresses constitutional values including the constitutional value of human dignity to the extent that common law determines rights and duties between individuals it might limit the human dignity of one individual and protect the human dignity of the other\n",
      "NUM we should therefore keep in mind that car instructions have also been issued keeping in view the spirit of human dignity enshrined in article NUM and the right that are to be ensured to such persons the underlying message in all these provisions is the acknowledgment that human rights are individual and have a definite linkage to human development both sharing common vision and with a common purpose respect for human rights is the root for human development and realisation of full potential of each individual which in turn leads to the augmentation of human resources with progress of the nation empowerment of the people through human development is the aim of human rights\n",
      "NUM in international human rights law equality is founded upon two complementary principles nondiscrimination and reasonable differentiation the principle of nondiscrimination seeks to ensure that all persons can equally enjoy and exercise all their rights and freedoms discrimination occurs due to arbitrary denial of opportunities for equal participation for example when public facilities and services are set on standards out of the reach of persons with disabilities it leads to exclusion and denial of rights equality not only implies preventing discrimination example the protection of individuals against unfavourable treatment by introducing antidiscrimination laws but goes beyond in remedying discrimination against groups suffering systematic discrimination in society in concrete terms it means embracing the notion of positive rights affirmative action and reasonable accommodation the move from the patronising and paternalistic approach to persons with disabilities represented by the medical model to viewing them as members of the community with equal rights has also been reflected in the evolution of international standards relating specifically to disabilities as well as in moves to place the rights of persons with disabilities within the category of universal human rights see  report of united nations consultative expert group meeting on international norms and standards relating to disability NUM\n",
      "NUM earlier the traditional approaches to disability have depicted it as health and welfare issue to be addressed through care provided to persons with disabilities from a charitable point of view the disabled persons are viewed as abnormal deserving of pity and are and not as individuals who are entitled to enjoy the same opportunities to live a full and satisfying life as other members of society this resulted in marginalising the disabled persons and their exclusion both from the mainstream of the society and enjoyment of their fundamental rights and freedoms disability tends to be couched within a medical and welfare framework identifying people with disabilities as ill different from their nondisabled peers and in need of care because the emphasis is on the medical needs of people with disabilities there is a corresponding neglect of their wider social needs which has resulted in severe isolation for people with disabilities and their families\n",
