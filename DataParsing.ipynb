      "26 september 1973\n",
      "writ petition no 117 of 1973\n",
      "the judgment was delivered by  a alagiriswami j\n",
      "1  petitioner masud khan prays for his release on the ground that he an indian citizen has been illegally arrested and confined to jail under paragraph 5 of the foreigners internment order 1962 he had come to india from pakistan on the basis of a pakistani passport dated 1371954and indian visa dated 941956 in his application for visa he had stated that he had migrated to pakistan in 1948 and was in government service in pakistan in pwd as a darogha and had given his permanent address as hyderabad sind\n",
      "2  if these statements were correct the petitioner would clearly be a pakistani national when this fact was brought out in the counter affidavit filled on behalf of the respondent the petitioner filed a further affidavit stating that he was appointed as a police constable in hasanganj police station district fatehpur up in february 1947 and continued as a police constable till the middle of 1950 when he was dismissed from service and that he went to pakistan in the year 1951in the reply affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent it is stated that one md masood khan son of zahoor khan was enrolled as police constable on 1691947 and he was discharged from service on 2051949 it is fairly clear that this information culled from the english order book from 1101947 to 27121951 refers to the petitioner while therefore it is established that the petitioner did not go to pakistan in 1948 it cannot be said that it has been established that the petitioner went to pakistan only in 1951when he went to pakistan is a matter peculiarly within his knowledge and the produced no evidence in support of that statement\n",
      "3  considering the frequent change of ground which the petitioner has resorted to a mere statement from him cannot be accepted as true nor can we accept his contention that it is for the respondent to establish that lie did not go to pakistan in 1951 but that he went on some other date the petitioner has also alleged that he was married in up on 25th december 1949even assuming that this statement is correct the petitioner cannot establish that he is a citizen of india unless lie succeeds in establishing that he was in india on 2611950 if he bad been in india on 2611950 but had gone to pakistan in 1951 it would be for the central government to decide whether he is a pakistani national or an indian citizen even though he may have come to india on a pakistani passport in 1956 that question does not arise here\n",
      "4  we are not prepared to assume that the petitioner should be deemed to have been present in india on 2611950 as was urged on behalf of the petitioner there is no room for any such presumption under s9 of the foreigners act whenever a question arises whether a person is or is not a foreigner the onus of proving that he is not a foreigner lies upon him the burden is therefore upon the petitioner to establish that be is a citizen of india in the manner claimed by him and therefore be is not a foreigner this burden not having been discharged by the petitioner it should be held that he is a foreigner and his claim that he is an indian citizen cannot be dealt with under the foreigners internment order 1962 must be rejected\n",
      "5  it appears however that in 1960 he had been prosecuted before the subdivisional magistrate fatehpur under s 14 of the foreigner act and was acquitted on the ground that he was not a foreigner it was therefore contended that the question whether the petitioner is a foreigner or not is a matter of issue estoppels the decision that he was not a foreigner seems to have been based on the decision of the allahabad high court in mohd hanif khan v state air 1960 all 434 1959 indlaw all 154it was held there that a pakistani national who entered into india before the amendment to the foreigners act in 1957 when he could not be considered to be a foreigner could not be so held because of that amendment that decision was that of a learned single judge on the point at issue he differed from an earlier decision of a learned single judge of the same court in ali sher v the state air 1960 all 431 1959 indlaw all 153but he decided that case before him on a different point and did not think it necessary to refer the case before him to a bench for considering which of the two decisions was correct on the question regarding the nationality of a person who came to india on a pakistani passport before 1957 there are thus two conflicting decisions of the same court on the same point and the magistrate who decided the petitioners case followed one of them\n",
      "6  but that apart this matter could bedecided on another point the question of issueestoppels has been considered by this court in pritam singh v state of punjab air1956 sc 415 1955 indlaw sc 111 manipur administration v thokchom bira singh 1964 7 scr 123 1964 indlaw sc 413 and piara singh s state of punjab issueestoppels arises only if the earlier as well as the subsequent proceedings were criminal prosecutions in the present case while the earlier one was a criminal prosecution the present is merely an action taken under the foreigners internment order for the purpose of deporting the petitioner out of india\n",
      "7  it is nota criminal prosecution the principle of issue estoppels is simply this  that where an issue of fact has been tried by a competent court on a former occasion and a finding has been reached in favored an accused such a finding would constitute an estoppels or res judicator against the prosecution not as a bar to the trial and conviction of the accused for a different or distinct offence but as precluding the reception of evidence to disturb that finding of fact when the accused is tried subsequently even for different offence which might be permitted by law pritam singhs case 1955 indlaw sc 111 supra was based on the decision of the privy council in sambasivam v public prosecutor federation of malaya 1950 ac 458 in that case lord mcdermott speaking for the board said\n",
      "the effect of a verdict of acquittal pronounced by a competent court on a lawful charge and after a lawful trial is not completely stated by saying that the person acquitted cannot be tried again for the same offence to that it must be added that the verdict is binding and conclusive in all subsequent proceedings between the parties to the adjudication\n",
      "it should bekept clearly in mind that the proceeding referred to herein is a criminal prosecution the plea of issueestoppels not the same as the plea of double jeopardy or aura foist acquit in the king v wilkes 77 clr511\n",
      "divon j\n",
      "8  referring to the question of issue estoppel said view that there is an issue estoppels if it appears by record of itself or as explained by proper evidence that the same point was determined in favour of a prisoner in a previous criminal trial which is brought in issue on a second criminal trial of the same prisoners there must be prior proceeding determined against the crown necessarily involving an issue which again arises in a subsequent proceeding by the crown against the same prisoner the allegation of the crown in the subsequent proceeding must itself be inconsistent with the acquittal of the prisoner in the previous proceeding but if such a condition of affairs arises i see no reason why the ordinary rules of issueestoppels should not apply issueestoppels concerned with the judicial establishment of a proposition of law or fact between parties it depends upon wellknown doctrines which control the reiteration of issues which are settled by prior litigation\n",
      "the emphasis here again would be seen to be on the determination of criminal liability in marz v the queen 96 clr 62 the high court of australia said the crown is as much precluded by an estoppels by judgment in criminal proceedings as is a subject in civil proceedings the laws which gives effect to issue estoppels is not concerned with the correctness or incorrectness of the finding which amounts to an estoppels still less with the process of reasoning by which the finding was reached in fact it is enough that an issue or issues have been distinctly raised or found once that is done then so long as the finding stands if there be any subsequent litigation between the same parties no allegations legally inconsistent with the finding may be made by one of them against the other\n",
      "here again it is to be remembered that the principle applies to two criminal proceedings and the proceeding with which we are now concerned is not a criminal proceeding we therefore hold that there is no substance in this contention\n",

      "writ petition no 506 of 1986\n",
      "the judgment was delivered by sabyasachi mukharji j\n",
      "1  there is much ado about nothing about these cases these petitions seek to challenge the vires of s 141b and s 162 as well as incidentally s 30ii of the tamil nadu buildings lease and rent control act 1960 hereinafter called the tamil nadu rent act on the ground of being arbitrary discriminatory and unreasonable different petitions deal with different facts it is not necessary to set these out exhaustively but it would be appropriate to deal with the facts of writ petition no 506 of 1986 as a typical one in order to appreciate the points in issue in writ petition no 506 of 1986 the respondentlandlord on or about 21st of march 1978 after purchasing the premises no95 thyagaraja road t nagar madras from the erstwhile owner filed an eviction petition in the court of small causes madras for eviction of the petitioner herein from the premises where the petitioner had been carrying on a hotel business serving meals etc for four decades the grounds in the eviction petition were nonpayment of rent under sec tion 1021 of the tamil nadu rent act unlawful sub letting us 102iia causing damages to the premises us 102iii and also for the purposes of demolition and reconstruction under s 141b\n",
      "2  the learned judge of the trial court ordered eviction under s 141b of the tamil nadu rent act only for demolition and reconstruction and dismissed the other grounds and that is the only ground with which we are concerned in this appeal on 25th of february 1981 the appellate court dismissed the petitioners appeal by saying that the landlords were rich people and capable of demolition and reconstruction in order to put the premises to a more profitable use by putting up their own showroom on september 30 1982 the high court dismissed the civil revision petition of the petitioner and granted time till 31st of january 1983 for the petitioner to vacate the premises in question the petitioner thereafter filed a special leave petition against the judgment and order of the high court in this court\n",
      "3 this court initially ordered show cause notice and also granted ad interim exparte stay of dispossession on 29th january 1983 the city civil court madras granted interim injunction restraining the respondents from demolishing the building till the disposal of the application in the suit filed by the petitioner against the erstwhile owner and the present landlords for specific performance of an agreement to sell the premises to the petitioner according to the petitioner the injunction was confirmed and was still continuing and the said suit for specific performance was also pending in the city civil court madras\n",
      "4  on 17th of february 1986 this court dismissed the special leave petition after notice but directed that the decree for eviction would not be executed till 171186 it was observed by this court that the petitioner would be at liberty to file a writ petition uart 32 of the constitution if so advised challenging the validity of s 141b of the tamil nadu rent act as mentioned on behalf of the petitioner the petitioner filed this writ petition challenging the validity of s 141b and s 162 of the tamil nadu rent act on the ground that these were arbitrary discriminatory unreasonable and unconstitutional the petitioner contends in this writ petition that consequently the eviction order passed under s 141b and confirmed in appeal is also illegal the aforesaid several of the writ petitions are on this issue\n",
      "5  the main ground of attack on this aspect seems to be that while other rent acts in case of eviction for demolition permit and direct that after reconstruction the tenant should be inducted as tenant or given the opportunity to have the same space in the reconstructed building in the instant act no such option is given and no such obligation imposed upon the landlord and as such the impugned provision is illegal as being discriminatory against the tenant in order to examine the various aspects on this contention it will be necessary to examine in detail the relevant provisions of the act it should be borne in mind however that this was an act passed to amend and consolidate the law relating to the regulation of the letting of residential and nonresidential buildings and the control of rents of such buildings and the prevention of unreasonable eviction of tenants in the state of tamil nadu s 14 of the tamil nadu rent act states as follows\n",
      " 14 recovery of possession by landlord for repairs or for reconstruction\n",
      "1 notwithstanding anything contained in this act but subject to the provisions of ss 12 and 13 on an application made by a landlord the controller shall if he is satisfied\n",
      "a that the building is bona fide required by the landlord for carrying out repairs which cannot be carried out without the building being vacated or\n",
      "b that the building is bona fide required by the landlord for the immediate purpose of demolishing it and such demolition is to be made for the purpose of erecting a new building on the site of the building sought to be demolished pass an order directing the tenant to deliver possession of the building to the landlord before a specified date\n",
      "2 no order directing the tenant to deliver possession of the building under this section shall be passed\n",
      "a on the ground specified in cl a of subsection 1 unless the landlord gives an undertaking that the building shall on completion of the repairs be offered to the tenant who delivered possession in pursuance of an order under subs 1 for his reoccupation before the expiry of three months from the date of recovery of possession by the landlord or before the expiry of such further period as the controller may for reasons to be recorded in writing allow or\n",
      "b on the ground specified in cl b of subsection 1 unless the landlord gives an undertaking that the work of demolishing any material portion of the building shall be substantially commenced by him not later than one month and shall be completed before the expiry of three months from the date he recovers possession of the entire building or before the expiry of such further period as the controller may for reasons to be recorded in writing allow\n",
      "3 nothing contained in this section shall entitle the landlord who has recovered possession of the building for repairs to convert a residential building into a nonresidential building or a nonresidential building into a residential building unless such conversion is permitted by the controller at the time of passing an order under subs 1\n",
      "4 notwithstanding an order passed by the controller under cl a of subs 1 directing the tenant to deliver possession of the building such tenant shall be deemed to continue to be the tenant but the landlord shall not be entitled to any rent for the period commencing on the date of delivery of possession of the building by the tenant to the landlord and ending with the date on which the building is offered to the tenant by the landlord in pursuance of the undertaking under cl a of subs 2\n",
      "5 nothing in this section shall entitle any landlord of a building in respect of which the government shall be deemed to be the tenant to make any application under this section s 15 empowers the tenant to reoccupy after repairs there is no such provision in case of eviction on the ground of bona fide need for demolition and reconstruction this is one of the grounds of challenge\n",
      "6  s 16 deals with the right of the tenant to occupy the building if it is not demolished subs 2 which was amended and introduced by act 23 of 1973 dealing with the reconstructed building reads as follows\n",
      "162 where in pursuance of an order passed by the controller under cl b of subs 1 of section 14 any building is totally demolished and a new building is erected in its place all the provisions of this act shall cease to apply to such new building for a period of five years from the date on which the construction of such new building is completed and notified to the local authority concerned\n",
      "7  in this connection s 30 which exempts certain buildings may be referred to and subsection i is important it reads as follows\n",
      "30 exemption in the case of certain buildings nothing contained in this act shall apply to\n",
      "i any building for a period of five years from the date on which the construction is completed and notified to local authority concerned or\n",
      "ii any residential building or part thereof occupied by any one tenant if the monthly rent paid by him in respect of that building or part exceeds four hundred rupees\n",
      "8  in this appeal we are not concerned with cl ii of s 30 the challenge to whose validity has been accepted by this court in rattan arya and others v state of tamil nadu and another 1986 3 scc 3851986 indlaw sc 417 s 30ii of the tamil nadu rent act has been struck down as violative of art 14\n",
      "9  various submissions were urged in support of the several writ petitions sree raju ramachandran contended that in most of the indian statutes dealing with eviction of tenants there are provisions of reinduction of the tenant where the eviction is obtained on the ground of reconstruction after the premises in question is reconstructed it was submitted that in those statutes there is obligation on the landlord to reconstruct within a certain period and the corresponding right on the tenant evicted to be reinducted at the market rate to be fixed by the rent controller or by such authority as the court may direct\n",
      "10  our attention was drawn to several statutes namely maharashtra karnataka kerala west bengal and numerous others where there are provisions for reinduction of other tenants in the premises after reconstruction most of the provisions of other statutes provide for such induction while the tamil nadu rent act does not on this ground it was submitted that firstly that this is violative of art 14 of the constitution it was further submitted that s 162 of the tamil nadu rent act says that where in pursuance of an order of eviction passed by the rent controller under s 141b any building is totally demolished and a new building is erected in its place all the provisions of the act shall cease to apply to such new building for a period of five years\n",
      "11 it was submitted that neither the old tenant nor any new tenant was thus entitled to protection of the rent control act after reconstruction the old tenant cannot also get into the new building as of right this discrimination against the tenants in tamil nadu is invidious and violates art 14 of the constitution secondly it was submitted that if in case of repairs which also dislodges the tenants for limited period the tenants have a right to get into the premises after repairs under the tamil nadu rent act it is unreasonable that tenants should not have the same right in case of reconstruction it was urged that once the building is ready for occupation it should make no difference whether the readiness is after repairs or after construction it was urged that in both cases the tenants go out during the period of building work and they should equally come back into the building after repairs or reconstruction it was submitted on this ground also that not enjoining re induction of the evicted tenant after reconstruction is discriminatory and unconstitutional\n",
      "12 the classification of buildings reconstructed differently from the buildings repaired is not valid as it has no relation to the object or purpose of the act furthermore that all the tenants belong to one class and they could not be treated differently on this aspect it was further submitted that the provisions of reinduction in most of the rent acts re presented the standard of reasonableness in the landlord and the tenant law and the philosophy of rent control legislation it represented the national consensus of reasonable standard therefore any provision which according to learned counsel appearing for the different parties in the writ petitions was in variance with that standard was unreasonable and as such violative of art 14 of the constitution in aid of this submission various contentions were urged we are however unable to accept this submission\n",
      "13  learned attorney general appearing for the respondents submitted before us that the main provision of s 141b enables a landlord to make an application to the rent controller and the rent controller if he was satisfied that the building was bona fide required by the landlord for the immediate purpose of demolishing it for the purpose of erecting a new building on the site of the building sought to be demolished might pass an order directing the tenant to deliver possession of the building to the landlord before a specified date in the case of an application under s 141a of the tamil nadu rent act namely bona fide requirement for carrying out repairs it cannot be carried out without the building being vacated and it has to be done within three months to enable the tenant to reoccupy the building it has further to be borne in mind that in the case of demolition and reconstruction the landlord has to undertake that the work of demolishing any material portion of the building shall be substantially commenced by him not later than one month and the entire demolition work shall be completed before the expiry of three months from the date he recovers possession of the entire building\n",
      "14 see in this connection the provisions of s 16 of the said act the demolition has therefore to be completed within three months in the case of massive buildings demolition can overtake six months or even a year and hence the provision that for reasons to be recorded in writing the controller may allow such further period it has further to be borne in mind that after such demolition the reconstruction of a new building on the same site is bound to take time and such time depends upon the nature of the building to be erected and it might take years it was argued during that period a tenant was bound to have found some other suitable alternative accommodation on the other hand in the case of a building for repairs a tenant may arrange for temporary accommodation for a few months and return back to the building therefore provision for reinduction in the case of repairs and absence of such a provision in the case of demolition and reconstruction is quite understandable and rational\n",
      "15  it has to be borne in mind that it is not practicable and would be anamolous to expect a landlord to take back a tenant after a long lapse of time during which time the tenant must necessarily have found some suitable accommodation elsewhere this is the true purpose behind s 141b read with s 142b in the aforesaid view of the matter we are unable to accept the submission that in providing for reinduction of the tenant in case of repairs and not providing for such reinduction in case of reconstruction there is any unreasonable and irrational classification without any basis\n",
      "16  the other submission as noted above was that in most of the rent acts there was provision for reinduction of the tenants but there was no such provision in case of reconstruction in the tamil nadu rent act in the state of madhya pradesh v gc mandawar 1955 1 scr 599 1954 indlaw sc 40 a constitution bench of this court observed that art 14 of the constitution does not authorise the striking down of a law of one state on the ground that in contrast with a law of another state on the same subject its provisions are discriminatory nor does it contemplate a law of the centre or of the state dealing with similar subjects being held to be unconstitutional by a process of comparative study of the provisions of two enactments the source of authority for the two statutes being different art 14 can have no application it was observed\n",
      "17  it is necessary now to deal with the submission that the section is unreasonable for this one has to bear in mind the public purpose behind the legislation the tamil nadu buildings lease and rent control act 1960 was passed in 1960 a similar enactment which was in operation from 1949 to 1960 did not contain any provision like ss 14 to 16 providing for eviction of the tenant on the ground of demolition and reconstruction\n",
      "18  in 1949 however the enactment contained a provision empowering the government to exempt any building or class of buildings from all or any of the provisions of the act when the landlords desired to evict tenants on the ground of demolition and reconstruction they resorted to the remedy of moving the government by an application for exemption us 13 of the 1949 act\n",
      "19 the government by notification used to exempt any building or class of buildings from all or any of the provisions of the act in this connection reference may be made to the decision in s kannappa pillai and another v b venkatarathnam 78 law weekly 363 the government in that case when passing the order of exemption used to impose condition that the landlord should complete the reconstruction within four months from the date on which the premises were vacated by the tenants and that he should take back the old tenants into the reconstructed building at the rate demanded by the landlord subject to the fixation of fair rent however in view of the tenants conduct in resorting to writ proceedings challenging the order of exemption and in filing suits and having delayed the process of demolition and reconstruction the court in the exercise of discretion refused to extend the benefit of the condition as to re induction in favour of the tenants the further remedy was by writ proceedings before the high court by the landlord or the tenant who felt aggrieved as the case may be\n",
      "20  it was submitted on behalf of the respondents by the learned attorney general that the legislature in view of the experience gained from 1949 to 1960 enacted ss 14 to 16 of the act and which were introduced in the act of 1960\n",
      "21  it was urged that the 1960 act had improved the position it had provided as a ground of eviction of the tenant the requirement of the landlord for demolition and reconstruction of the building leaving it to a judicial authority viz rent controller to decide the matter with one statutory right of appeal and a further right of revision to the district court or the high court as the case may be it was on this ground urged that leaving the matter to judicial adjudication as to the ground for eviction it cannot be held to be arbitrary unreasonable or unjust this point has to be judged keeping in view the main purpose of the act in question and the relevant submissions on this aspect\n",
      "22  it may be borne in mind that historically the constitutionality of s 13 of the act of 1949 was upheld on the touchstone of art 14 both by the madras high court and on appeal by this court in pj irani v the state of madras 1962 2 scr 169 1961 indlaw sc 69 it was held that s 13 of the act did not violate art 14 and was not unconstitutional enough guidance according to the judgment of the majority of learned judges was afforded by the preamble and the operative provisions of the act for the exercise of the discretionary power vested in the government it was observed that the power us 13 of the act was to be exercised in cases where the protection given by the act caused great hardship to the landlord or was the subject of abuse by the tenants it was held by sinha cj ayyangar and mudholkar jj that s 13 was ultra vires and void an order made us 13 was subject to judicial review on the grounds that a it was discriminatory b it was made on grounds which were not germane or relevant to the policy and purpose of the act and c it was made on grounds which were mala fide while sk das and ak sarkar jj emphasised that the order passed by the government us 13 was a competent and legal order all that the court had to see was whether the power had been used for any extraneous purpose ie not for achieving the object for which the power was granted\n",
      "23  the act of 1960 contains a corresponding provision for exemption in s 29 of the act which corresponds to s 13 of the act of 1949 was also upheld by this court in s kandaswamy chettiar v state of tamil nadu and another 1985 2 scr 398 1984 indlaw sc 354 dealing with s 29 of the act this court observed that the rationale behind the conferral of such power to grant exemptions or to make exceptions was that an inflexible application of the provisions of the act might under some circumstances result in unnecessary hardship entirely disproportionate to the good which will result from a literal enforcement of the act and also the practical impossibility of anticipating in advance such hardship to such exceptional cases in the matter of beneficial legislations also there were bound to be cases in which an inflexible application of the provisions of the enactment might result in unnecessary and undue hardship not contemplated by the legislature the power to grant exemption under s 29 of the act therefore has been conferred not for making any discrimination between tenants and tenants but to avoid undue hardship or abuse of the beneficial provisions that might result from uniform application of such provisions to cases which deserve different treatment\n",
      "24 the decision reiterated that the tamil nadu rent act was a piece of beneficial legislation intended to remedy the two evils of rackrenting exaction of exorbitant rents and unreasonable eviction generated by a large scale of influx of population to big cities and urban areas in the post second world war period creating acute shortage of accommodation in such areas and the enactment avowedly protects the rights of tenants in occupation of buildings in such areas from being charged unreasonable rents and from being unreasonably evicted therefrom in that view of the matter it had made a rational classification of buildings belonging to government and buildings belonging to religious charitable educational and other public institutions and the different treatment accorded to such buildings us 103b of the act\n",
      "25  the scope of this act was discussed by this court in raval and co v kc ramachandran  ors 1974 2 scr 629 1973 indlaw sc 283 where the majority of the court at pages 635 to 636 observed\n",
      "all these show that the madras legislature had applied its mind to the problem of housing and control of rents and provided a scheme of its own it did not proceed on the basis that the legislation regarding rent control was only for the benefit of the tenants it wanted it to be fair both to the landlord as well as the tenant apparently it realised that the pegging of the rents at the 1940 rates had discouraged building construction activity which ultimately is likely to affect every body and therefore in order to encourage new constructions exempted them altogether from the provisions of the act it did not proceed on the basis that all tenants belonged to the weaker section of the community and needed protection and that all landlords belonged to the better off classes it confined the protection of the act to the weaker section paying rents below rs250 it is clear therefore that the madras legislature deliberately proceeded on the basis that fair rent was to be fixed which was to be fair both to the landlords as well as to the tenants and that only the poorer classes of tenants needed protection the facile assumption on the basis of which an argument was advanced before this court that all rent acts are intended for the protection of tenants and therefore this act also should be held to be intended only for the protection of tenants breaks down when the provisions of the act are examined in detail the provision that both the tenant as well as the landlord can apply for fixation of a fair rent would become meaningless if fixation of fair rent can only be downwards from the contracted rent and the contract rent was not to be increased of course it has happened over the last few years that rents have increased enormously and that is why it is argued on behalf of the tenants that the contract rents should not be changed if we could contemplate a situation where rents and prices are coming down this argument will break down it is a realisation of the fact that prices and rents have enormously increased and therefore if the rents are pegged at 1940 rates there would be no new construction and the community as a whole would suffer that led the madras legislature to exempt new buildings from the scope of the act it realised apparently how dangerous was the feeling that only fools build houses for wise men to live in at the time the 1960 act was passed the madras legislature had before it the precedent of the madras cultivating tenants payment of fair rent act 1956 that act provides for fixation of fair rent it also provides that the contract rent if lower will be payable during the contract period even if the contract rent is higher only the fair rent will be payable after the contract period is over only the fair rent is payable the madras legislature having this act in mind still made only the fair rent payable and not the contract rent if it happens to be lower it is clear therefore that the fair rent under the present act is payable during the contract period as well as after the expiry of the contract period\n",
      "26  the act sought to restore the balance in the scale which is otherwise weighted in favour of the stronger party which had larger bargaining power the act balances the scales and regulates the rights of the parties fairly and cannot be construed only in favour of the tenant\n",
      "27  in murlidhar agarwal and another v state of up and others 1975 1 scr 5751974 indlaw sc 264 this court had occasion to deal with this matter in that case powers of high court to interfere with revisional orders passed by state government under section 7f of up temporary control of rent and eviction act 1947 were challenged the court was of the view that if a provision was enacted for the benefit of a person or class of persons there was nothing which precluded him or them from contracting to waive the benefit provided that no question of public policy was involved in doing so the question arose what was the public policy involved in the said rent act there can be no doubt about the policy of the law namely the protection of a weaker class in the community from harassment of frivolous suits but the question is is there a public policy behind it which precludes a tenant from waiving it mathew j reiterated that public policy does not remain static in any given community it may vary from generation to generation and even in the same generation public policy would be almost useless if it were to remain in fixed moulds for all time the rent act however balances both the sides the landlord and the tenant\n",
      "28  the main provision of s 141b enables a landlord to make an application to the rent controller and the rent controller if he is satisfied that the building is bonafide required by the landlord for the immediate purpose of demolishing it for the purpose of erecting a new building on the site of the building sought to be demolished may pass an order directing the tenant to deliver possession of the building to the landlord before a specified date\n",
      "29  s 16 provides for the tenant to occupy the building if it is not demolished in certain contingencies the scheme of the section was very carefully analysed in shah bhojraj kuverji oil mills and ginning factory v subbash chandra yograj sinha 1962 2 scr 159 1961 indlaw sc 472\n",
      "30  in metalware and co etc v bansilal sharma and ors etc 1979 3 scr 11071979 indlaw sc 225 this court emphasised that the phrase used in s 141b of the act was the building was bona fide required by the landlord for the immediate purpose of demolition and reconstruction and the same clearly referred to the bona fide requirement of the landlord this court emphasised that the requirement in terms was not that the building should need immediate demolition and reconstruction the state or condition of the building and the extent to which it could stand without immediate demolition and reconstruction in future would not be a totally irrelevant factor while determining the bona fide requirement of the landlord this court emphasised that if the rent controller had to be satisfied about the bona fide requirement of the landlord which meant genuineness of his claim in that behalf the rent controller would have to take into account all the surrounding circumstances including not merely the factors of the landlord being possessed of sufficient means or funds to undertake the project and steps taken by him in that regard but also the existing condition of the building its age and situation and possibility or otherwise of its being put to a more profitable use after reconstruction all these factors being relevant must enter the verdict of the rent controller on the question of the bona fide requirement of the landlord under s 141b\n",
      "31 the fact that a landlord being possessed of sufficient means to undertake the project of demolition and reconstruction by itself might not be sufficient to establish his bona fide requirement if the building happened to be a very recent construction in a perfectly sound condition and its situation might prevent its being put to a more profitable use after reconstruction the rent controller has thus to take into account the totality of the circumstances and the factors referred to in the judgment by lesser or greater significance depending upon whether in the scheme of the concerned enactment there is or there is not a provision for reinduction of the evicted tenant into the new construction reference was made to the decision of this court in neta ram v jiwan lal 1962 suppl 2 scr 623 1962 indlaw sc 123 there must be bona fide need of the landlord on all the conditions required to be fulfilled that being the scheme of the section it cannot be said in our opinion that the section was arbitrary and excessive powers were given to the landlords absence of provision for reinduction does not ipso facto make the provisions of the act unfair or make the act self defeating\n",
      "32  it has been borne in mind that the provisions of the act imposed restrictions on the landlords right under the common law or the transfer of property act to evict the tenant after termination of his tenancy the rationale of these restrictions on the landlords rights is the acute shortage of accommodation and the consequent need to give protection to the tenants against unrestricted eviction the nature the form and the extent of the restrictions to be imposed on the landlords right and the consequent extent of protection to be given to the tenants is a matter of legislative policy and judgment it is inevitably bound to vary from one state to another depending on local and peculiar conditions prevailing in the state and the individual states appreciation of the needs and problems of its people when we are confronted with the problem of a legislation being violative of article 14 we are not concerned with the wisdom or lack of legislative enactment but we are concerned with the illegality of the legislation there may be more than one view about the appropriateness or effectiveness or extent of the restrictions there may be also more than one view about the relaxation of the restrictions on the landlords right of eviction this fact is reflected in the different provisions made in different acts about the grounds for eviction for example in case of assam meghalaya andhra pradesh delhi haryana orissa tripura east punjab madhya pradesh tamil nadu kerala mysore himachal pradesh and pondicherry no particular duration for arrears of rent is prescribed which would entitle a landlord to maintain an action for ejectment of his tenant\n",
      "however in other cases a certain period is prescribed for instance two months in bihar west bengal and jammu and kashmir three months in goa and tripura four months in uttar pradesh six months in bombay and rajasthan again some rent acts require that before an action for ejectment on the ground of arrears is instituted a notice demanding rent should be served on the tenantfor example bombay delhi kerala tripura jammu and kashmir madhya pradesh and up rent acts in such cases the tenant is given one chance to pay up the arrears again different rent acts provide different facts and circumstances on the basis of which premises could be recovered on the ground of bona fide personal requirement generally the bona fide requirement extends both to residential as well as commercial premises however the delhi rent control act restricts the right on account of the bona fide need of the landlords right to premises let for residential use only\n",
      "further bihar bombay goa jammu and kashmir karnataka tamil nadu up and west bengal rent acts provide for partial eviction but there is no such provision in the other acts it is obvious from the above that there can be no fixed and inflexible criteria or grounds governing imposition of restrictions on the landlords right or for relaxation of those restrictions in certain cases ultimately it is a matter of legislative policy and judgment\n",
      "courts are not concerned with the unwisdom of legislation\n",
      "in short unconstitutionality and not unwisdom of a legislation is the narrow area of judicial review\n",
      "33 see in this connection the observations of krishna iyer j in murthy match works etc etc v the asstt collector of central excise etc 1974 3 scr 121 1974 indlaw sc 509 this court approved the above passage from the american jurisprudence and emphasised that in a classification for governmental purposes there cannot be an exact exclusion or inclusion of persons and things it is important to bear in mind the constitutional command for a state to afford equal protection of the law sets a goal not attainable by the invention and application of a precise formula therefore a large latitude is allowed to the states for classification upon any reasonable basis see also in this connection the observations of this court in re the special courts bill 1978 1979 2 scr 476 1978 indlaw sc 352 where chandrachud cjspeaking for the court at pages 534to537 of the report laid down the propositions guiding art 14 and emphasised that the classification need not be constituted by an exact or scientific exclusion nor insist on delusive exactness or apply doctrinaire tests for determining the validity of classification in any given case classification therefore is justified if it is not palpably arbitrary we also in view of the different provisions we have discussed bear in mind the fact that there is no such consensus among the different states about the right of reinduction of tenant in case of eviction required for demolition it will depend on the particular state and appreciation of the need and problem at a particular point of time by that state concerned the purpose underlying s 141b read with s 162 of the tamil nadu rent act is to remove or mitigate the disinclination on the part of landlords to expend moneys for demolition of dilapidated buildings and reconstruct new buildings in their places it is a matter of which judicial notice can be taken that the return from old and dilapidated buildings is very meagre and in several cases such buildings prove uneconomic for the landlords with the result that the condition of the building deteriorates and there are even collapses of such buildings it is for this purpose that the landlord is given by s 141b read with s 16 an incentive in the form of exemption from the provisions of the rent act in respect of reconstructed building for the limited and short duration of five years the policy under s 141b read with s 16 is not in essence different from the policy adopted by different states of giving exemption for a limited duration to newly constructed buildings\n",
      "34 these provisions namely exemption of new buildings from the provisions of the rent act for a period of five years or ten years has been upheld as constitutional see in this connection the observations of this court in the case of punjab tin supply co chandigarh  ors v the central govt  ors 1984 1 scc 206 1983 indlaw sc 259 and mohinder kumar v state of haryana and anr 1985 4 scc 221 at pages 2262271985 indlaw sc 262 there the court emphasised that it is entirely for the legislature to decide whether any measures and if so what measures are to be adopted for remedying the situation and for ameliorating the hardship of tenants the legislature may very well come to a conclusion that it is the shortage of buildings which has resulted in scarcity of accommodation and has created a situation where the demand for accommodation is far in excess of the requisite supply and it is because of such acute scarcity of accommodation the landlords are in a position to exploit the situation to the serious detriment of the tenants\n",
      "the court observed at pages 226to227 of the report as under\n",
      "the legislature in its wisdom may properly consider that in effecting an improvement of the situation and for mitigating the hardship of the tenanted class caused mainly due to shortage of buildings it will be proper to encourage construction of new buildings as construction of new buildings will provide more accommodation easing the situation to a large extent and will ultimately result in benefiting the tenants as in view of the rigours of rent control legislation persons with means may not be inclined to invest in construction of new houses the legislature to attract investment in construction of new houses may consider it reasonable to provide for adequate incentives so that new constructions may come up it is an elementary law of economics that anybody who wants to invest his money in any venture will expect a fair return on the investment made as acute scarcity of accommodation is to an extent responsible for the landlord and tenant problem a measure adopted by the legislature for seeking to meet the situation by encouraging the construction of new buildings for the purpose of mitigating the hardship of tenants must be considered to be a step in the right direction the provision for exemption from the operation of the rent control legislation by way of incentive to persons with means to construct new houses has been made in s 13 of the act by the legislature in the legitimate hope that construction of new buildings will ultimately result in mitigation of the hardship of the tenants such incentive has a clear nexus with the object to be achieved and cannot be considered to be unreasonable or arbitrary any such incentive offered for the purpose of construction of new buildings with the object of easing the situation of scarcity of accommodation for ameliorating the conditions of the tenants cannot be said to be unreasonable provided the nature and character of the incentive and the measure of exemption allowed are not otherwise unreasonable and arbitrary the exemption to be allowed must be for a reasonable and a definite period an exemption for an indefinite period or a period which in the facts and circumstances of any particular case may be considered to be unduly long may be held to be arbitrary the exemption must necessarily be effective from a particular date and must be with the object of promoting new constructions with the commencement of the act the provisions of the rent act with all the restrictions and rigours become effective buildings which have been constructed before the commencement of the act were already there and the question of any kind of impetus or incentive to such buildings does not arise the legislature therefore very appropriately allowed the benefit of the exemption to the buildings the construction of which commenced or was completed on or after the commencement of the act this exemption in respect of buildings coming up or to come up on or after the date of commencement of the act is likely to serve the purpose of encouraging new buildings to be constructed there is therefore nothing arbitrary or unreasonable in fixing the date of commencement of the act from which the exemption is to be operative\n",
      "35  s 141b has sufficient inbuilt guidelines the requirements to be satisfied before initiating action under this provision have been judicially laid down by the madras high court by anantanarayanan j as he then was in mehsin bhai v hale and company g t madras 1964 2 madras law journal 147 anantanarayanan j observed at page 147 as follows\n",
      " what the section really required is that the landlord must satisfy the court that the building was bona fide required by him for the immediate purpose of demolition i am totally unable to see how the present state of the building and the extent to which it could stand without immediate demolition and reconstruction in the future are not relevant considerations in assessing the bona fides of the landlord on the one hand landlords may bona fide require such buildings particularly old buildings in their own interest for demolition and reconstruction on the other hand it is equally possible that the mere fact that the building is old is taken advantage of by the landlord to put forward such pretext his real object being ulterior and not bona fide for the purpose of reconstruction the courts have to apply several criteria and to judge upon the totality of the facts but the courts cannot exclude the possibility that the ancient or relatively old character of the building which may nevertheless be in quite a good and sound condition is being taken advantage of by a landlord in order to make such an application with an ulterior purpose which purpose might be for instance to obtain far more advantageous terms of rent in the future what the section really contemplates is a bona fide requirement that necessarily implied that it is in the interests of the landlord to demolish and reconstruct the building and that the fact that the building is old is not merely a pretext for advancing the application with the object of evicting the tenant and of obtaining higher rentals\n",
      "36  this court also emphasised this aspect in the decision of metalware  co etc v bansilal sharma and others etc 1979 3 scr 1107 at pages 111711181979 indlaw sc 225\n",
      "37  we are therefore unable to accept the submission that absence of the right of induction of tenants in reconstructed premises is either arbitrary or unreasonable the submission that s 162 which provides that when a building is totally demolished and on which a new building is erected shall be exempt from all the provisions of the act for a period of five years is bad is also unsustainable see in this connection the observations of this court in ms punjab tin supply co chandigarh etc etc v the central government and others 1984 1 scr 428 1983 indlaw sc 259 and motor general traders and another etc etc v state of andhra pradesh and others etc etc 1984 1 scr 594 at page 605 1983 indlaw sc 256 it was submitted that the fact that in these cases exemption was after the first construction of the building and not after demolition and reconstruction but that would not make any difference to the principle applicable\n",
      "38 the principle underlying such exemption for a period of five years is not discriminatory against tenants nor is it against the policy of the act it only serves as an incentive to the landlord for creation of additional housing accommodation to meet the growing needs of persons who have no accommodation to reside or to carry on business it does not create a class of landlords who will forever be kept outside the scope of the act as the provision balances the interests of the landlords on the one hand and the tenants on the other in a reasonable way this court in atam prakash v state of haryana and others 1986 2 scc 249 1986 indlaw sc 276 also judged the rules of classification in dealing with the punjab preemption act 1913\n",

      "40  our attention was drawn to certain observations of chatterjee j of the calcutta high court in jiwanlal  co and others v manot and co ltd 64 calcutta weekly notes 932 at page 937 that where the landlord had established a case of building and rebuilding the tenants undoubtedly would suffer on ejectment the learned judge was of the view that though the landlords required the premises for the purpose of building and rebuilding it was not desirable that the tenants should be ejected the learned judge emphasised that the purpose of the act was to protect the tenants as long as possible and to eject them only when it was not otherwise possible the landlords did not require it for their own use and occupation\n",
      "41 they wanted it for the advantage of increased accommodation the learned judge was of the view that if the tenants were ejected then for the time being far from the problem being solved it would create difficulties for the public as well as for themselves we are however unable to accept this principle it is true that the act must be so construed that it harmonises the rights of the landlords and at the same time protects the tenants and also serves best the purpose of the act and one of the purposes of the act is to solve the acute shortage of accommodation by making a rational basis for eviction and to encourage building and rebuilding which is at the root of all causes of shortage of accommodation\n",

      "appeal cr 688 of 1995\n",
      "the judgment was delivered by  ruma pal j\n",
      "1 the appellant was found guilty of an offence us 138 of the negotiable instruments act 1881 by the special court set up under the special court trial of offences relating to transactions in securities act 1992 referred to as the act the appellant was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for a term of one year and a fine for a sum of rs 1 lakh in default to undergo further rigorous imprisonment for a term of three months aggrieved by the judgment and order of the special court the appellant has preferred this appeal\n",
      "2 in the course of the hearing of the appeal before this court learned counsel for the appellant raised a preliminary issue based on the language of sub s 2 of s 3 of the act it was contended that the jurisdiction of the special court was limited to offences committed between 1 april 1991 and on or before 6 june 1992 and the offence alleged having taken place after 6 june 92 the special court had no jurisdiction to try it the bench then hearing the appeal recorded in its order dated 7 sepetember 1999\n",
      "   prima facie we are not in agreement with the contention raised by the learned counsel for the appellant on first principles but the learned counsel for the appellant has brought to our notice a judgment of this court in the case of minoo mehta vs sharak d mehta 1998 2 scc 418 1998 indlaw sc 438 in the aforesaid judgment on facts of that case this question possibly did not arise for consideration but even otherwise their lordships have come to the conclusion \n",
      "therefore every offence pertaining to any transaction in securities which is covered by the sweep of the act that is if such transaction has taken place between 1 april 1991 and on or before 6 june 1992 would be subjected to the provisions of the act regarding trial of such an offence\n",
      "having held so in the later part of the said paragraph the lordships have come to the conclusion\n",
      "the offence referred to in subs 2 of s 3 which is within the sweep of s 7 of the act must be on offence committed by any person and must have the following two characteristics\n",
      "such offence must relate to transactions in securities and\n",
      "such offence should be alleged to have been committed between 1april 1991 and on or before 6 june 1992\n",
      "this statement of law is contrary to what their lordships have said in the earlier paragraph as referred to earlier and we are not in agreement with the enunciation made in the second part of above in this view of the matter we think it appropriate that this appeal should be placed before a 3judge bench\n",
      "the matter was thereafter placed before this bench and heard\n",
      "3 the apparently contradictory observations in minoo mehta v shavak d mehta 1998 indlaw sc 438 need resolution with reference to the provisions of the act\n",
      "the act was promulgated on 6 june 92 to provide for the establishment of a special court for the trial of offences relating to transactions in securities and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto\n",
      "4 the jurisdiction of the special court was specified in s 7 and was limited to offences referred to in s 32 of theact s 32 insofar as it is relevant provides\n",
      " any offence relating to transactions in securities after the 1 day of april 1991 and on and before 6th june 1992\n",
      "5 the question is  does the period specified qualify the word offence or the word transactions  if it is the former the jurisdiction of the special court would be as contended by the appellant limited to offences committed within the period specified whenever the transactions may have taken place the respondent has however contended that the period qualifies the word transactions and that this was not only clear from the language of the statutory provisions but also supported by authority\n",
      "6 in our view the respondents submission is correct and must be accepted the statement of objects and reasons of theact gives the background and the focus of thract as \n",
      "large scale irregularities and malpractices were noticed in transactions in both the government and other securities indulged in by some brokers in collusion with the employees of various banks and financial institutions\n",
      "7 the preamble to thract also makes it clear that the purpose of the enactment was to deal with those particular transactions in securities in subs 2 of s 3 the statutory period occurs after the word transaction if the period were to qualify the word offence the section would have read any offence after the 1st day of april and on or before 6 june 1992 from the language used it is apparent that the period relates to the transaction in securities and that the date of the offence is immaterial other sections of theact also show that the object of act is those particular transactions which were carried out during a particular period of time thus s 4 of thrthe act allows the custodian under certain circumstances to cancel any contract or agreement entered into at any time after the first day of april 1991 and on or before the 6th june of 1992 the position has been further clarified by section 9a1b introduced by way of amendment in 1994 which confers on the special court all the jurisdiction powers and authority as were exercisable immediately before the commencement of the amended act by any civil court in relation to interalia any matter or claim \n",
      "arising out of transactions in securities entered into after the 1st day of april 1991 and on or before the 6th day of june 1992 in which a person is notified under sub s 2 of sec 3 is involved as a party broker intermediary or in any other manner\n",
      "8 in these circumstances the inevitable conclusion is that the ambit of the special courts jurisdiction whether in criminal proceedings or in civil disputes is in respect of the transactions in securities entered into after the 1st day of april 1991 and on or before 6th day of june 1992 that the period mentioned in s 32 refers to the transactions and not to the offence is a view which found favour with this court in harshad shantilal mehta v custodian and others 1998 indlaw sc 732 a bench of threejudges of this court after considering the various sections of theact held\n",
      "therefore the jurisdiction of the special court in civil as well as criminal matters is in respect of transactions during the statutory period of 1 april 1991 to 6 june 1992 and in relation to the properties attached of a notified person the entire operation of the said act therefore revolves around the transactions in securities during this statutory period\n",
      "9 in our opinion the decision in mino mehta v shavak d mehta 1998 indlaw sc 438 supra does not decide to the contrary in that case shares had been lodged with the accused by the complainant in december 1991 the accused was to arrange the sale of the shares and to pay the sale proceeds to the complainant in january 1992 the accused sold the shares and misappropriated the sale proceeds thus the transactions in securities as well as the offence of misappropriation had both taken place during the period specified in s 3 subs 2 the only issue before the court was whether the special court would have jurisdiction to deal with offences even if the accused was not notified by the custodian the learned judges decided the issue in the affirmative\n",
      "while reaching its conclusion the court observed\n",
      " the scheme of section 7 in the light of the preamble of theact and the main purpose for enactment of theact appears to be that all criminal proceedings pertaining to prosecutions in connection with the accused involved in transactions in securities during the relevant period will lie before the special court and not before ordinary courts as the section starts with a non obstante clause stating that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law only special courts will have exclusive jurisdiction to try such offences\n",
      "10 because the offence and the transactions overlapped the learned judges did not make a distinction between the transaction and the offence when they summed up their conclusions by saying \n",
      "the offence referred to in subs 2 of section 3 which is within the sweep of s 7 of theact must be an offence committed by any person and must have the following two characteristics\n",
      "such offence should be alleged to have been committed between 1 april 1991 and on or before 6 june 1992 the use of the word offence in item 2 was an obvious error because what was meant has been made clear by the court in the judgment which reads before parting with this case we may state that the learned senior counsel for the appellant also submitted that the offence alleged against the appellant was not relating to any transaction in securities during the relevant time but qua the sale consideration alleged to have been received by the appellant out of the said transaction and for which alleged offence us 409 prosecution is sought to be launched against the appellant it is difficult to agree with this contention a conjoint reading of the recitals in the complaint which obviously must be assumed to be true at this stage would show that the accused is alleged to have entered into transaction in securities namely the shares during the relevant period and out of the said transaction is alleged to have received sale proceeds which he has not handed over or transmitted to the complainant who claims to be entitled to the said amount thus the offence alleged is certainly relating to the transaction in securities as said to have been entered into by the accused during the relevant period\n",
      "11 it is clear therefore that the summing up did not correctly reflect the actual view of the court in the present case the four cheques which are the subject matter of the criminal proceedings were admittedly executed by the appellant on 24 december 1991 26 december 1991 17 february 1992 and 27 march 1992 ie within the statutory period the cheques were drawn on the andhra bank in favour of the standard chartered bank briefly referred to as the bank for the sums of rs27 crores rs145 crores rs17 crores and rs199575000 respectively according to the bank the cheques were issued for payment of loss suffered by the bank arising out of transactions in securities entered into by the bank through or at the instance of the appellant during the statutory period according to the bank on 21 may 1992 all four cheques were returned dishonoured by the andhra bank with the remark not arranged for the bank served notices on the appellant us 138 of the negotiable instruments act on 31 may 1992 and 1 june 1992 calling upon the appellant to make payment in respect of the four cheques within 15 days from the date of the receipt of the notices the appellant did not pay the transactions as alleged being within the statutory period the special court had the jurisdiction to entertain the complaint and the preliminary objection of the appellant is in the circumstances rejected\n",
      "12 on the merits of the case also we do not find any reason to interfere with the decision of the special court in the complaint filed on behalf of the bank by one bratindranath banerjee the respondent herein on 14 july 1992 it was alleged that the appellant was acting as a broker in respect of security transactions between the bank and other banks and financial institutions according to the complaint the appellant had issued the four cheques in discharge of his liabilities to the bank the four cheques were presented to andhra bank but were dishonoured a first information report was lodged against the appellant and others in the written statement filed by the appellant us 247 of the code of criminal procedure it was said that pursuant to an oral information from the banks officer that the bank was working on some new scheme and methods of augmenting its income and request for assistance for the same the appellant agreed to certain formalities and adjustments as and when required pursuant to this arrangement the appellant had executed and sent several cheques to the bank including the four cheques ext b c d  e which related to certain intended transactions of purchase of security by the appellant from the standard chartered bank according to the appellant none of these intended transactions actually materialised and as a result the cheques were never to be acted upon or encashed it was denied that the appellant was liable to make any payment in respect of the four cheques according to the appellant although the transactions had not taken place and the cheques should have been returned the four cheques were not returned back to the appellant by the bank through oversight\n",
      "13 it is unnecessary to consider the various preliminary stages of the trial before the special court except to note that charges were framed on 26 august 1992 by the special court against the appellant us 138 of the negotiable instruments act 1881\n",
      "14 that the four cheques were executed by the appellant in favour of the standard chartered bank hereafter referred to as the bank has not been denied nor was it in dispute that the cheques were dishonoured because of insufficient funds in the appellants account with the drawee viz andhra bank because of the admitted execution of the four cheques by the appellant the bank was entitled to and did in fact rely upon three presumptions in support of its case namely under sections 118 138 and 139 of the negotiable instruments act s 118 provides interalia that until the contrary is proved it shall be presumed that every negotiable instrument was made or drawn for consideration and that every such instrument when it has been accepted indorsed negotiated or transferred was accepted indorsed negotiated or transferred for consideration the presumption which arises us 138 provides more specifically that where any cheque drawn by a person on an account for payment of any amount of money for the discharge in whole or in part of any debt or other liability is returned by the drawee bank unpaid either because of the amount of money standing to the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the cheque such persons shall be deemed to have committed an offence and shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque or with both the nature of the presumption us 138 is subject to the three conditions specified relating to presentation giving of the notice and the nonpayment after receipt of notice by the drawer of the cheque all three conditions have not been denied in this case\n",
      "15 the appellants submission that the cheques were not drawn for the discharge in whole or in part of any debt or other liability is answered by the third presumption available to the bank us 139 of the negotiable instruments act this section provides that it shall be presumed unless the contrary is proved that the holder of a cheque received the cheque of the nature referred to in s 138 for the discharge in whole or in part of any debt or other liability the effect of these presumptions is to place the evidential burden on the appellant of proving that the cheque was not received by the bank towards the discharge of any liability\n",
      "16 because both ss 138 and 139 require that the court shall presume the liability of the drawer of the cheques for the amounts for which the cheques are drawn as noted in state of madras vs a vaidyanatha iyer air 1958 sc 61 1957 indlaw sc 9 it is obligatory on the court to raise this presumption in every case where the factual basis for the raising of the presumption had been established it introduces an exception to the general rule as to the burden of proof in criminal cases and shifts the onus on to the accused such a presumption is a presumption of law as distinguished from a presumption of fact which describes provisions by which the court may presume a certain state of affairs presumptions are rules of evidence and do not conflict with the presumption of innocence because by the latter all that is meant is that the prosecution is obliged to prove the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt the obligation on the prosecution may be discharged with the help of presumptions of law or fact unless the accused adduces evidence showing the reasonable possibility of the nonexistence of the presumed fact\n",
      "17 in other words provided the facts required to form the basis of a presumption of law exists no discretion is left with the court but to draw the statutory conclusion but this does not preclude the person against whom the presumption is drawn from rebutting it and proving the contrary a fact is said to be proved when after considering the matters before it the court either believes it to exist or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought under the circumstances of the particular case to act upon the supposition that it exists  therefore the rebuttal does not have to be conclusively established but such evidence must be adduced before the court in support of the defence that the court must either believe the defence to exist or consider its existence to be reasonably probable the standard of reasonability being that of the prudent man judicial statements have differed as to the quantum of rebutting evidence required in kundan lal rallaram vs custodian evacuee property bombay air 1961 sc 1316 1961 indlaw sc 528 this court held that the presumption of law under s 118 of negotiable instruments act could be rebutted in certain circumstances by a presumption of fact raised us 114 of the evidence act the decision must be limited to the facts of that case the more authoritative view has been laid down in the subsequent decision of the constitution bench in dhanvantrai balwantrai desai vs state of maharashtra air 1964 sc 575 1962 indlaw sc 82 where this court reiterated the principle enunciated in state of madras vs vaidyanath iyer supra and clarified that the distinction between the two kinds of presumption lay not only in the mandate to the court but also in the nature of evidence required to rebut the two in the case of a discretionary presumption the presumption if drawn may be rebutted by an explanation which might reasonably be true and which is consistent with the innocence of the accused on the other hand in the case of a mandatory presumption the burden resting on the accused person in such a case would not be as light as it is where a presumption is raised under s114 of the evidence act and cannot be held to be discharged merely by reason of the fact that the explanation offered by the accused is reasonable and probable it must further be shown that the explanation is a true one the words unless the contrary is proved which occur in this provision make it clear that the presumption has to be rebutted by proof and not by a bare explanation which is merely plausible a fact is said to be proved when its existence is directly established or when upon the material before it the court finds its existence to be so probable that a reasonable man would act on the supposition that it exists unless therefore the explanation is supported by proof the presumption created by the provision cannot be said to be rebutted\n",

      "18 we will therefore have to consider whether in the case before us the appellant had supported his defence by any proof sufficient to rebut the presumption drawn against him at the trial three witnesses were examined in support of the banks case the first was a mr derek reed pw 1 the banks group security adviser mr reed deposed that he had come to india with instructions from the bank to investigate the fraud which appeared to have been perpetrated in bombay in which several banks including the bank were involved in the course of investigation he found the four cheques ext b c d  e from the desk of an officer of the bank who has since been dismissed because of his involvement in the fraud\n",
      "19 the banks second witness was mr s gyananavinayagam pw2he was the manager operations in andhra bank he deposed that the four cheques were dishonoured on the ground of insufficient funds in the appellants account the third witness mr bratindra nath banerjee pw 3 was the director of the bank incharge of the india task force set up by the bank to investigate the fraud his was the primary evidence relied upon by the bank broadly speaking mr banerjee deposed that there were two main areas of fraud perpetrated by the appellant according to him the first fraud committed by the appellant related to large amounts paid by the bank at the instance of the appellant or through him for which the bank had failed to receive any security or valid bank receipts the second fraud pertained to the actual purchase and sale of securities at the instance of the appellant and the failure of the appellant to pay the bank the difference between the contract rate and delivery rate of the securities he verified the statements pertaining to the transactions between the appellant and the bank prepared on the basis of the banks books of account and other records maintained in the usual course of the business of the bank all the statements ex o p q and t were tendered in evidence and marked as exhibits without any objection by the appellant\n",
      "20 the first statement pertained to the period between 8 november 1991 and 18 december 1991 and showed the contract rates delivery rates the rates of difference and the amount of difference of securities mentioned the statement along with the deal slips cost memos instruction issued by the reserve bank of india and entry in a clearing sheet in respect of four deal slips were marked as ext o out of ext o difference of rates covered by four deal slips had been settled by the appellant by giving a cheque for rs15 crores the balance amount on this account was rs457740250 the second statement prepared and vouched for by mr banerjee was ext p prepared in connection with transactions between 28 december 1991 and 17 february 1992 the statement was supported by 18 deal slips the liability of the appellant on this account was claimed to be rs565050000 ext p was subsequently corrected by ext t which gave the figure of appellants liability for the period covered by ext p as rs395050000 the third statement was marked as ext q this gave particulars of the claim for the period 21 february 1992 to 27 march 1992 the appellants liability for this period was claimed to be rs309734135 ext q was supported by five deal slips\n",
      "21 all the deal slips which were printed forms and serially numbered showed the contract rate and the delivery rates they were prepared by dealers of the bank mr banerjee also stated that the use of the abbreviation dir in the column which required the name of the broker referred to the appellant the witness also showed that in respect of certain transactions where the contract rate was less than the delivery rate the appellant was paid by the bank in dealing with the appellants case namely that the cheques had been given for intended deals which had never taken place mr banerjee said that he had gone through all the deal slips which had been brought with him to the court and that there was no evidence of any cancellation of any deal between the appellant and the bank\n",
      "22 in the course of his examination mr banerjee also gave evidence of payment made by the bank to the appellant amounting to rs1240 crores and of the loss suffered by the bank on account of the nonfurnishing of bank receiptssecurities\n",
      "23 two further witnesses were produced by the bank one proved the appellants account with the bank and the second proved the appellants account with andhra bank for the relevant period\n",
      "24 as far as the appellants defence was concerned he did not enter the witness box to support his case that the four cheques in particular had been given in respect of any arrangement or in respect of any transactions which did not materialise the four witnesses called by the appellant apart from those subpoenaed to produce documents were mr ramesh laxman kamat dw 1 mr sr a rao dw 2 mr g d bhalla dw 3 and mr g ckc talukdar dw 4 the special court found that the evidence of dw 1 was not creditworthy and that almost all points including inconsequential points and points which could not be denied he prevaricated  and  sought to deny the truth until truth could no longer be denied dw 1 was then a deputy general manager of the state bank of india referred to as sbi he had sought to contend that a number of transactions mentioned in the four statements viz exs o p and q were ready forward transactions between the bank and sbi and did not reflect the sale and purchase of securities it was a case which he was unable to substantiate with reference to the documents already on record or produced from the custody of the cbi the documents produced by the witness himself were found by the special court to be suspect\n",
      "25 the second witness for the defence mr sra rao also sought to establish that one transaction in exo was non existent or a dummy transaction the third defence witnessmr gd bhalla branch manager of andhra bank proved that the appellant had made payments of several crores to the bank\n",
      "26 the fourth witness gk talukdar a staff officer of the reserve bank of india produced a list stipulating contract rates of several securities in an attempt to show that the contract rates claimed by the bank were not correct it was not stated that the list applied to the bank or that other rates could not be contracted for\n",
      "27 the brunt of the evidence given by the appellants witnesses was as to the nature of the transactions between the appellant and the bank however not one of the defence witnesses gave any evidence in support of the only defence of the appellant namely that the four cheques in question had been given towards intended transactions which did not take place no one said why the appellant had executed and delivered the particular cheques to the bank or that the appellant had not given the four cheques to discharge his debts to the bank nor did any defence witness claim that the cheques were given an account of any ready forward transactions in fact dw 1 in cross examination admitted that it was not the practice of a purchasing party to hand over cheques in advance the appellant alone could have said why he had admittedly executed the four cheques handed them over to the bank and never asked for their return he did not choose to do so\n",
      "as said by the special court \n",
      "thus according to the accused the cheques exs b and c were delivered on 23 december 1991 this ostensibly was for intended purchases of 2 crores and 108 crores units according to him the cheque ex d was given on 17 february 1992 this ostensibly for intended purchase of 12250000 units the ex was allegedly given on 27th march 1992 for intended purchase of 7 crore units of can star and 10 crore units of can premium apart from what is stated in the written statement there is no evidence or proof in support of this case\n",
      "28 the burden was on the appellant to disapprove the presumptions under ss 138 and 139 a burden which he failed to discharge at all the averment in the written statement of the appellant was not enough incidentally the defence in the written statement that the four cheques were given for intended transactions was not the answer given by the appellant to the notice us 138 then he had said that the cheques were given to assist the bank for restructuring exh it was necessary for the appellant at least to show on the basis of acceptable evidence either that his explanation in the written statement was so probable that a prudent man ought to accept it or to establish that the effect of the material brought on the record in its totality rendered the existence of the fact presumed improbable vide trilok chand jain vs state of delhi 1975 4 scc 761 1975 indlaw sc 220  the appellant has done neither in the absence of any such proof the presumptions under ss 138 and 139 must prevail\n",
      "29 we may also mention here that in proceedings initiated by the bank to recover monies from the appellant in connection with the first area of fraud mentioned by b banerjee pw 3 this court in standard chartered bank vs custodian 2000 6 scc 427 2000 indlaw sc 276 upholding the decision of the special court found that the appellant was liable to pay the bank a sum of rs28000 crores which is several times the amount covered by the four cheques in question the argument of the appellant before the special court that no offence us 138 had in fact been committed because he could not have paid within the period of 15 days after receipt of the notice even if he wanted to was rightly rejected the appellants submission was based on the fact that he had been notified by the custodian us 3 of theact and all his properties had consequently stood attached but as observed by the learned special court the special court had before it a number of applications by a number of parties asking for permission to fulfill their obligations under contracts in some cases the court had granted them there was nothing which prevented the appellant from applying to the special court for permission to fulfill his obligations or to pay off his debts under the cheques exs b c d  e no attempt had bean make by the appellant to make any payment towards the dishonoured cheques the appellant would not have paid even if he could have this is clear not only from the correspondence and the appellants conduct but also from his defence of total denial of liability the argument was therefore wholly academic\n",
      "30 the special court found the appellants defence improbable and the evidence adduced at his instance flawed and unbelievable after meticulously scanning both the oral and documentary evidence and ultimately drawing on the presumptions statutorily provided under sections 118 138 and 139 of the negotiable instruments act the appellant was found guilty for the reasons stated earlier there is no ground for us to decide differently and to differ from the view taken by the special court in holding the appellant guilty of the offence with which he was charged we therefore affirm the conviction and sentence imposed on the appellant by the special court and dismiss the appeal with costs assessed at rs10000\n",

      "1  the appellants herein namely ashok kumar sankar and babu in criminal appeal no 1533 of 2004 and selvakumar in criminal appeal no 1174 of 2005 a1 a3 a4 and a2 respectively along with their father chakravarti nayinar a5 mother gunasekariammal a7 and uncle rajan a6 stood trial for commission of offences under sections 147 148 341 447 302 read with section 109 read with section 149 of the indian penal code ipc inter alia for causing death of one kumararaja the accused as also the deceased kumararaja were residents of ammeri village taluk gingee they had their agricultural lands in the said village the accused were claiming share of the land belonging to said kumararaja they had allegedly been causing disturbances in the possession of the lands belonging to kumararaja as a result whereof some criminal cases were pending against a5 and a6 a5 and a6 with a view to attend the said criminal cases left the village at about 600 am on 29101993 they had allegedly instructed the appellants before leaving the village to see that the deceased did not plough the land in question and if despite warning he would do so he should be killed at about 830 am the deceased kumararaja went to the said land and began ploughing the same which was objected to by the appellants herein he reported the matter to elanchziyan pw1 and devabalan pw2 who advised him to convene a panchayat so that the dispute between the parties may be settled in response whereto the deceased allegedly told them that the matter need not be referred to panchayat as the land belonged to him\n",
      "2 he had therefore requested both the said pws to accompany him to the land in question and ask the appellants not to cause any obstruction in his ploughing the land they complied with the said request of the deceased further case of the prosecution is that as soon as the deceased entered into the disputed land and tried to plough gunasekariammal a7 allegedly brought four koduval knives and handed over each one of them to the appellants and instigated them to kill the deceased whereupon they attacked the deceased the deceased fell down pw1 and pw2 cried out seeing the incident whereupon they were also threatened thereafter they ran away with the weapons pw1 and pw2 came near the deceased and found kumararaja dead the village came within the jurisdiction of valathi police station it was situated at a distance of about 8 kms from the village pw1 walked all the way to the police station he reached the police station at about 1130 am at that time head constable ansar sherif pw10 was present he was although attached to gingee police station at the relevant point of time having been instructed by inspector mohan doss michael pw11 he was performing his duties at the valathi police station head constable pw 10 recorded the statement of pw1 a copy of the first information report was sent to the inspector pw11 who came to the scene of occurrence at about 1230 pm in the meantime pw1 and pw2 had also reached the place of occurrence the statements of pw1 pw2 as also of those who were witnesses to mahazar were recorded postmortem examination on the dead body was conducted by dr marimuthu pw9 on 30101993\n",
      "3  the following injuries were found on the dead body of the deceased\n",
      "1 incised wound cut wound across the top of the head 15x40 in deep in brain brain incised to about 1 cm depth subdural haematoma about 100 cc on the left parietal area\n",

      "8 abrasion on the left side neck 4x1 cm\n",
      "9 abrasion on the back of right forearm 2x1 cm\n",
      "4  according to the doctor pw9 the injuries were antemortem in nature and were possible to have been caused by a sharpedged knife or koduval knife upon completion of the investigation a charge sheet was filed against all the accused\n",
      "5  before the learned sessions judge inter alia a plea was taken that another first information report had been lodged in regard whereto an entry had been made in the general diary however the same had not been produced the learned sessions judge upon consideration of the evidences brought on record including those of the eyewitnesses namely pw1 and pw2 found the prosecution case to have been proved beyond all reasonable doubt and recorded a judgment of conviction against all the accused persons on an appeal being preferred before the high court the high court did not believe that part of the prosecution case involving a5 and a6 who admittedly had left the village at 600 am on 29101993 as also that of a7 who allegedly had come to the scene and distributed the weapons to the appellants herein they were therefore acquitted during the pendency of the appeal before the high court a6 expired and his appeal thus was held to have abated the appeal filed by the appellants herein before the high court however was dismissed\n",
      "6  mr v krishnamurthy the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants in support of the appeals inter alia submitted that keeping in view the genesis of the occurrence it was obligatory on the part of the prosecution to prove that the land in question belonged to the deceased drawing our attention to the statements made by the investigating officer the learned counsel would submit that admittedly no witness was examined to establish the ownership and possession of the deceased over the land in question and the prosecution cannot be said to have proved its case it was further submitted that the general diary having not been produced which was called for by the appellants with a view to show that another report had also been lodged prior to the lodging of the first information report by pw 1 and the same having not been produced by the prosecution an adverse inference ought to have been drawn by the learned courts below\n",
      "7 mr krishnamurthy urged that the prosecution has further not been able to prove that the head constable pw10 who was admittedly attached to the gingee police station was at the relevant point of time asked by the inspector pw 11 to perform his duties at valathi police station it was furthermore contended that the high court committed a serious error in placing reliance upon the evidence of pw1 on the premise that he was a disinterested witness and had nothing to do with the dispute between the parties although it had been brought on record that the younger sister of the deceased was married to his sisters son the learned counsel urged that in a case of this nature where the title of the land was disputed the learned courts below should have considered the question as to whether in a situation of this nature the appellants could have exercised their right of private defence in regard to the property\n",
      "8  it is not in dispute that both the parties were related to each other the deceased being a coparcener of the appellants it is furthermore not in dispute that the parties had been disputing over the ownership of the land the appellants had been disputing the absolute ownership of the deceased in regard to the land in question on the ground that they were also coowners thereof pw1 was thus related to both the parties nothing has been brought on record to show that he had anything to do with the land in question and for one reason or the other he would side with the deceased it has also not been established that pw1 was otherwise inimically disposed toward the accused both pw1 and pw2 made categorical statements to the effect that they had gone to the scene of occurrence with a view to prevent the appellants from causing obstructions to the ploughing of land by the deceased they were requested to do so by the deceased in fact pw1 as would appear from his evidence advised the deceased to take the matter to the panchayat so that the dispute between the parties could be resolved\n",
      "9  he did not pay any heed to his advice and insisted that he had a right to plough the land as the same belonged to him pw1 in his deposition made detailed statements as to how and in what manner the deceased was attacked with knives by all the appellants he had furthermore stated the manner in which the injuries were caused to the deceased by each one of them he had also identified the weapons of assault in court the statements made by the said witness stand corroborated by the medical evidence pw2 also supported him in all material particulars the fact that he was the author of the first information report is not disputed having found the deceased to have expired at the place of occurrence he only went to his house for putting on his shirt and started for the police station he had to walk 8 kms three hours must have been taken to reach the police station it has further not been denied or disputed that the investigating officer pw11 reached the place of occurrence at about 1230 pm on the same date and started investigation the statement of pw10 who recorded the first information report has also been taken by the investigating officer\n",
      "10  it may be true that the investigating officer might not have made any investigation as regards the ownership of the land but from his evidence it is evident that he had been informed and proceeded on the basis that the land in question had been in possession of the deceased the prosecution story is that the deceased had been ploughing the land and thus his possession thereover cannot be disputed pw11 had drawn a rough sketch which was marked as ex p13 sl nos 1 to 7 of the said sketch indicate the land of the deceased and his brother raj kumar and sl no 3 thereof indicates the place where the dead body was found being survey no 126 the learned trial judge has categorically arrived at a finding that from the evidence on record it was established that the occurrence took place on the land of the deceased being survey no 126 in the centre of kumararajas karambu land kumararajas own land being situated on the west of that land and shown in sl no 4 of the said sketch ex p13\n",
      "11  the investigating officer on the date of occurrence did not find the appellants in the village they were arrested after a few days from another village the appellants herein before the court below did not contend that they had been in possession of the land if they intended to raise a right of private defence in regard to the property it was for them to prove that they were in possession of the land and the deceased trespassed thereinto no contention as regard the exercise of right of private defence in regard to their person had thus been or could be raised\n",
      "12  in hafiz vs state of up 2005 12 scc 599 2005 indlaw sc 861 this court categorically observed \n",
      "it may be true that the right of private defence need not specifically be taken and in the event the court on the basis of the materials on record is in a position to come to such a conclusion despite some other plea having been raised that such a case had been made out it may act thereupon mutually destructive defences taken by the accused persons would also go a long way to disbelieve their story \n",
      "13  the deceased was not armed and was all alone when he first started ploughing the land only when he was obstructed from doing so he approached pw1 and pw2 evidence of pw1 appears to be natural he is not only said to be an eyewitness he walked all the way to the police station to lodge the first information report as public transport was not available in the first information report he categorically stated that pw2 was also an eyewitness the investigating officer pw11 had also found the injuries on the person of the deceased despite some minor contradictions both the trial judge and the high court placed reliance upon the evidence of pw1 and pw2 we do not find any reason to differ with their opinion\n",
      "14  submission of mr krishnamurthy that another first information report was also lodged earlier is based only on a suggestion made to pw 10 pw10 in his deposition categorically denied that even before lodging the complaint exp1 another complaint was lodged at valathi police station it is true that the learned trial judge had recorded a contention raised on behalf of the accused that despite an application having been filed by the accused the prosecution had failed to produce case diary and general diary relating to the date of occurrence of the valathi police station when however questioned the learned counsel could not point out from the records of the case that any such application was filed by the accused or any order had been passed by the learned trial judge calling for the general diary from the police station\n",
      "15 the question of drawing an adverse inference against the prosecution for nonproduction of the case diary or the general diary would have arisen had the court passed an order being satisfied that the prosecution intended to suppress some facts which were material for the purposes of arriving at the truth or otherwise of the prosecution case if no such application had been filed and no order thereupon had been passed by the court the question of drawing any adverse inference against the prosecution would not arise we have noticed hereinbefore that pw10 made a categorical statement to the effect that prior to the lodging of the first information report no other report had been lodged if that be so the question of production of any document did not arise unless it had been pointed out by the accused with reference to the number or the person who made such report as to the existence or recording of any other case in the general diary even no suggestion to that effect has been given to pw1 we therefore have no hesitation to reject the said contention\n",
      "16  we are for the reasons aforementioned of the opinion that the learned trial court and the high court having considered the prosecution case from all angles no case has been made out for our interference therewith the appeals are therefore dismissed\n",

      "11 september 1962\n",
      "petition no 62 of 1962\n",
      "the judgment was delivered by  k n wanchoo j\n",
      "1 the short question raised in this writ petition under art 32 of the constitution is whether production bonus is included within the term basic wages as defined in s 2b of the employees provident funds act no 19 of 1952 hereinafter referred to as the act writ petition 64 of 1962 the jay engineering works limited v the union of india 1962 indlaw sc 311 was heard along with this petition in that writ petition a further question arose as to the nature of the production bonus scheme in force in that company and parties have been given time to file additional affidavits in that connection what we say therefore in the present case as to reduction bonus generally may not be taken necessarily to apply to the particular scheme in the case of writ petition no 64 of 1962\n",
      "2 the brief facts necessary for present purposes are these petitioner no 1 hereinafter referred to as the company is a public limited company engaged in the manufacture of engineering goods structural fabrication and rolling stock and the act applies to the company the company has a production bonus scheme in force which provides for payment of production bonus over and above wages fixed by the major engineering award of 1958 published in the calcutta gazette dated november 5 1958 which governs 74 major engineering concerns in that region including the company that award is still in force and has fixed basic wages and dearness allowance on time rate basis for the entire major engineering industry\n",
      "3 in addition to basic wages and dearness allowance payable under the award the company has two production bonus schemes one for the hourly rated workers and the other for the rest it is unnecessary to go into the details of the two schemes but the main feature of the two schemes is that production bonus begins to be paid on certain rates specified in the two schemes when the output reaches 5000 tons per year and that no production bonus is paid when the output is less than 5000 tons per year it may be added that the scheme relating to the hourly rated workers has been revised from january 1 1962 and the main feature of this revision is that the scheme is now applicable to those workers on a quarterly basis according to this revised scheme production bonus begins when the output for the quarter reaches 1300 tons and there is no production bonus if the output is below 1300 tons in the case of other staff the old scheme is still in force though it is stated for the company that negotiations are going on for revising the old scheme presumably to bring it into line with the new scheme introduced for hourly rated workers since january 1 1962\n",
      "4 we may now briefly refer to the relevant provisions of the act which require consideration the act provides by s 5 for the introduction of employees provident fund scheme for certain industries included in schedule 1 to the act in consequence a provident fund scheme was framed in september 1952 knows as the employees provident funds scheme 1952 and it is applicable to the company s 6 of the act provides for contribution by the employer and the employee to the provident fund and this contribution is 6 14 per centum of the basic wages dearness allowance end retaining allowance if any for the time being payable in the ease of both s 6 further provides for certain increased contribution but we are not concerned with that in the present case basic wages have been defined in s 2b of the act thus\n",
      "basic wages means all emoluments which are earned by an employee while on duty or on leave with wages in accordance with the terms of the contract of employment and which are paid or payable in cash to him but does not include\n",
      "the cash value of any food concession\n",
      "any dearness allowance that is to say all cash payments by whatever name called paid to an employee on account of a rise in the cost of living houserent allowance overtime allowance bonus commission or any other similar allowance payable to the employee in respect of his employment or of work done in such employment\n",
      "any presents made by the employer\n",
      "5 further s 19a of the act provides for the removal of difficulties and lays down that if any difficulty arises in giving effect to the provisions of the act and in particular if any doubt arises as to certain matters including whether the total quantum of benefits to which an employee is entitled has been reduced by the employer the central government may by order make such provision or give such direction not inconsistent with the provisions of the act as appears to it to be necessary or expedient for the removal of the doubt or difficulty and the order of the central government in such cases shall be final\n",
      "6 it appears that difficulties and doubts arose on the question whether production bonus could be taken into account in calculating the contribution of 614 per centum under s 6 of the act and the central government directed about the march 7 1962 that the question whether production bonus should be liable to provident fund deduction under the act had been reexamined by it and it had been decided that production bonus payable as part of a contract of employment either at a flat rate or at a rate linked to the quantum of work turned out satisfied the definition of basic wages under s 2 b of the act the company was further directed to effect recovery of provident fund contributions on production bonus without any farther delay and arrear contribution in this respect payable with effect from january 1 1960 was also to be deposited in the statutory fund immediately the present petition was thereafter filed in april 1962 and is directed against the decision of the central government which was duly communicated to the company in march 1962\n",
      "7 the main contention of the company is that bonus without any qualification has been expected from the terra  basic wages in the definition in s 2b of the act therefore all kinds of bonus whether it be profit bonus or production bonus or attendance bonus or festival bonus either as an implied condition of service or as a customary payment are excluded from basic wages farther s6 which provides for contribution only refers to basic wages dearness allowance and retaining allowance if any and contributions have to be made at the appropriate rate on these three payments and not on bonus which is not included in s 6 it is urged that when the act was passed in 1952 the legislature was aware of the various kinds of bonus which were being paid by various concerns in various industries and when it decided to exclude bonus without any qualification from the term basic wages as defined in s 2b it was not open to the central government to direct that production bonus should be included in basic wages for the purposes of contribution under s 6 besides this contention based on the interpretation of the word bonus in s 2b it is further contended that if the word bonus therein excludes production bonus the provision would be unconstitutional as it would be hit by art 14 of the constitution inasmuch as production bonus is not a general feature of all industrial concerns but has been introduced only in some the result of including production bonus within basic wages would be that some concerns where production bonus prevails would be contributing to the provident fund at a much higher rate than others where no production bonus prevails\n",
      "8 the petition has been opposed on behalf of the union of india and also on behalf of the two trade unions which are existing in the company it is contended for the respondents that wages are the price for labour and arise out of contract and the use of the term basic wages merely indicates that a certain part of the total wages is being separated for certain purposes only therefore production bonus being in the nature of incentive wage must be included in the definition of the term basic wages in s 2b as basic wages there defined are all emoluments which are earned by an employee while on duty or on leave with wages in accordance with the terms of the contract of employment and which are paid or payable in cash to him therefore production bonus being in the nature of an incentive wage is included in the terms all emoluments in the definition of basic wages for production bonus is earned by an employee while on duty in accordance with the terms of the contract of employment it is further submitted that when the word bonus was used in el ii of the exceptions to s 2b it only referred to profit bonus as it was well established before 1952 that the use of the word bonus without any qualification referred to profit bonus only in industrial adjudications therefore when cl ii of the exceptions to s 2b accepted bonus without any qualification it referred only to profit bonus and not to any other kind of bonus\n",
      "9 the main question therefore that falls for decision is as to which of these two rival contentions is in consonance with s 2 b there is no doubt that basic wages as defined therein means all emoluments which are earned by an employee while on duty or on leave with wages in accordance with the terms of the contract of employment and which are paid or payable in cash if there were no exceptions to this definition there would have been no difficulty in holding that production bonus whatever be its nature would be included within these terms the difficulty however arises because the definition also provides that certain things will not be included in the term basic wages and these are contained in three clauses the first clause mentions the cash value of any food concession while the third clause mentions any presents made by the employer the fact that the exceptions contain even presents made by the employer shows that though the definition mentions all emoluments which are earned in accordance with the terms of the contract of employment care was taken to exclude presents which would ordinarily not be earned in accordance with the terms of the contract of employment similarly though the definition includes all emoluments which are paid or payable in cash the exception excludes the cash value of any food concession which in any case was not payable in cash the exceptions therefore do not seem to follow any logical pattern which would be in consonance with the main definition\n",
      "10 then we come to el ii it excludes dearness allowance houserent allowance overtime allowance bonus commission or any other similar allowance payable to the employee in respect of his employment or of work done in such employment this exception suggests that even though the main part of the definition includes all emoluments which are earned in accordance with the terms of the contract of employment certain payments which are in fact the price of labour and earned in accordance with the terms of the contract of employment are excluded from the main part of the definition of basic wages it is undeniable that the exceptions contained in cl ii refer to payments which are earned by an employee in accordance with the terms of his contract of employment it was admitted by counsel on both sides before us that it was difficult to find any one basis for the exceptions contained in the three clauses\n",
      "11 it is clear however from cl ii that from the definition of the word basic wages certain earnings were excluded though they must be earned by employees in accordance with the terms of the contract of employment having excluded dearness allowance from the definition of basic wages a 6 then provides for inclusion of dearness allowance for purposes of contribution but that is clearly the result of the specific provision in s6 which lays down that contribution shall be 614 per centum of the basic wages dearness allowance and retaining allowance if any we must therefore try to discover some basis for the exclusion 987 in cl ii as also the inclusion of dearness allowance and retaining allowance for any in s 6 it seems that the basis of inclusion in s 6 and exclusion in cl ii is that whatever is payable in all concerns and is earned by all permanent employees is included for the purpose of contribution under s 6 but whatever is not payable by all concerns or may not be earned by all employees of a concern is excluded for the purpose of contribution\n",
      "12 dearness allowance for examples is payable in all concerns either as an addition to basic wages or as a part of consolidated wages where a concern does not have separate dearness allowance and basic wage similarly retaining allowance is pay able to all permanent employees in all seasonal factories like sugar factories and is therefore included in a 6 but houserent allowance is not paid in many concerns and sometimes in the same concern it is paid to some employees but not to others for the theory is that houserent is included in the payment of basic wages plus dearness allowance or consolidated wages therefore houserent allowance which may not be payable to all employees of a concern and which is certainly not paid by all concern is taken out of the definition of basic wages even though the basis of payment of house rent allowance where it is paid is the contract of employment similarly overtime allowance though it is generally in force in all concerns is not earned by all employees of a concern\n",
      "13 it is also earned in accordance with the terms of the contract of employment but because it may not be earned by all employees of a concern it is excluded from basic wages similarly commission or any other similar allowance is excluded from the definition of basic wages for commission and other allowances are not necessarily to be found in all concerns nor are they necessarily earned by all employees of the same concern though where they exist they are earned in accordance with the terms of the contract of employment it seems therefore that the basis for the exclusion in cl ii of the exceptions in s 2 b is that all that is not earned in all concerns or by all employees of concern is excluded from basic wages\n",
      "14 to this the exclusion of dearness allowance in cl ii is an exception but that exception has been corrected by including dearness allowance in s 6 for the purpose of contribution dearness allowance which is an exception in the definition of basic wages is included for the purpose of contribution by s 6 and the real exceptions therefore in el ii are the other exceptions beside dearness allowance which has been included through s 6\n",
      "15 this brings us to the consideration of the question of bonus which is also an exception in el ii now the word bonus has been used in this clause without any qualification therefore it would not be improper to infer that when the word bonus was used without any qualification in the clause the legislature had in mind every kind of bonus that may be payable to an employee it is not disputed on behalf of the respondents that bonuses other than profit bonus were in force and wellknown before the act came to be passed in 1952 for example the coal mines provident fund and bonus schemes act no 46 of 1948 provided for payment of bonus depending on attendance of employees during any period besides the attendance bonus four other kinds of bonus had been evolved under industrial law even before 1952 and were in force in various concerns in various industries\n",
      "16 there was first production bonus which was in force in some concerns long before 1952 see messrs titaghur paper mills co limited v its workmen 1959 supp 2 scr 1012 1959 indlaw sc 84 then there was festival or puja bonus which was in force as an implied term of employment long before 1952 see messrs ispahani limited calcutta v ispahani employees union 1960 1 scr 24 1959 indlaw sc 97 then there was customary bonus in connection with some festival see the graham trading co india limited v its workmen 1960 1 s c r 107 1959 indlaw sc 99 and lastly there was profit bonus the principles underlying which and the determination of whose quantum were evolved by the labour appellate tribunal in the mill owners association v the rashtriya mill mazdoor sangh bombay 1950 ilj 1247\n",
      "17 the legislature therefore could not have been unaware that these different kinds of bonus were being paid by different concerns in different industries when it passed the act in 1952 therefore unless the contention on behalf of the respondents that bonus when it was used without qualification can only mean profit bonus is sound it must be held that when the legislature used the term bonus without any qualification in cl ii of the exception in s 2 b it must be referring to every kind of bonus which was prevalent in the industrial field before 1952 the contention therefore of the respondents that when the term bonus was used in industrial law before 1952 without any qualifying term it meant only profit bonus and nothing else requires careful consideration\n",
      "18 we do not think however that this contention is well founded it is true as will appear from the terms of reference in various cases of profit bonus that the word profit was not used as a qualifying word before the word bonus in such cases it may also be that in many cases where a particular type of bonus was in dispute say attendance or puja bonus the qualifying word attendance or puja was use in references but it appears that where was in connection with profit bonus the usual practice was to make the reference after qualifying the word bonus by the year for which the profit bonus was claimed for example we may refer to the case of mill owners association bombay v the bashtrya mill mazdoor sangh 1950 llj 1247 the term of reference in reference no 1 of 1948 mill owners association bombay v the employees in the cotton textile mills bombay in these terms\n",
      "re bonus for the year 1947\n",
      "19 it seems therefore that when reference was with respect to profit bonus the term bonus though not qualified by the word profit bad always been limited by specifying the year for which the bonus was being claimed though therefore it may be true that literally speaking the word  profit was not used to qualify the word bonus when references were made with respect to profit bonus the matter was put beyond controversy that the use of the word bonus without any qualification was with reference to profit bonus by adding the year for which the bonus was being claimed it would therefore be not right to say that in industrial adjudications before 1952 bonus without any qualifying word meant profit bonus and nothing else further though the word profit was not used to qualify the word bonus the intention was made quite clear when profit bonus was meant by using the words for the year so and sol after the word bonus\n",
      "20 we are therefore not prepared to accept that where the word bonus is used without any qualification it only means profit bonus and nothing else on the other hand it seems to us that the use of the word bonus without any qualifying word before it or without any limitation as to year after it must refer to bonus of all kinds known to industrial law and industrial adjudication before 1952 the reason for the exclusion of all kinds of bonus is also in our opinion the same which led to the exclusion of house rent allowance overtime allowance commission and any other similar allowance namely that payment of bonus may not occur in all industrial concerns or it may not be made to all employees of an industrial concern as for example attendance bonus and that is why bonus of all kinds was also excluded from the definition of the term basic wages\n",
      "the act is an allindia act applicable to all industries mentioned in sch i and to all concerns engaged in those industries and the intention behind the exclusion seems to be to make the incidence of provident fund the same in all industrial concerns which are covered by the act so that it was necessary to exclude from the wide definition of basic wages given in the opening part all such payments which would not be common to all industries or to all employees in the same concern we have already pointed out that to this principle only dearness allowance in cl ii is an exception but that exception has been corrected by the inclusion of dearness allowance in s6 we are therefore of opinion that there is no reason why when the word bonus is used in el ii without any qualifying word it should not be interpreted to include all kinds of bonus which were known to industrial adjudication before 1952 and which must therefore be deemed to be within the knowledge of the legislature\n",
      "21 this brings us to the consideration of the contention raised on behalf of the respondents that wages are the price for labour and arise out of contract and that whatever is the price for labour and arises out of contract was intended to be included in the definition of basic wages in s2 b and that only those things were excluded which were a reward for labour not arising out of the contract of employment but depending on various other considerations like profit or attendance it may be as we have pointed out earlier that if there were no exceptions to the main part of the definition in s2b whatever was payable in cash as price for labour and arose out of contract would be included in the term basic wages and that reward for labour which did not arise out of contract might not be included in the definition but the main part of the definition is subject to exceptions in cl ii and those exceptions clearly show that they include even the price for labour\n",
      "22 it is therefore not possible to accept the contention on behalf of the respondents that whatever is price for labour and arises out of contract is include 1 in the definition of basic wages and therefore production bonus which is a kind of incentive wage would be included this court had occasion to consider production bonus in messrs titaghur paper mills co ltd v its workmen 1959 supp 2 s cr 10 12 1959 indlaw sc 84 it was pointed out that the payment of production bonus depends upon production and is in addition to wages in effect it is an incentive to higher production and is in the nature of an incentive wage\n",
      "23 rho straight piece rate plan where payment is made according to each piece produced is the simplest of incentive wage plans in a straight piece rate plan payment is made according to each piece produced and there is no minimum and the worker is free to produce as much or as little as he likes his payment depending upon the number of pieces produced but in such a case payment for all that is produced would be basic wage as defined in s 2b of the act even though the worker is working under an incentive wage plan the difficulty arises where the straight piece rate system cannot work as when the finished product is the result of the cooperative effort of a large number of workers each doing a small part which contributes to the result in such a case the system of production bonus by tonnage or by any other standard is introduced the core of such a plan is that there is a base or a standard above which extra payment is earned for extra production in addition to the basic wages which is the payment for work up to the base or standard\n",
      "24 such a plan typically guarantees time wage up to the time represented by standard performance and gives workers a share in a savings represented by superior performance the scheme in force in the company is a typical scheme of production bonus of this kind with a base or standard up to which basic wages as time wages are paid and thereafter extra payments are made for superior performance this extra payment may be called incentive wage and is also called production bonus in all such cases however the workers are not bound to produce anything beyond the base or standard that is set out\n",
      "25 the performance may even fall below the base or standard but the minimum basic wages will have to be paid whether the base or standard is reached or not when however the workers produce beyond the base or standard what they earn is not basic wages but production bonus or incentive wage it is this production bonus which is outside the definition of basic wages in s 2 b for reasons which we have already given above the production bonus in the present case is a typical production bonus scheme of this kind and whatever therefore is earned as production bonus is payable beyond a base or standard and it cannot form part of the definition of basic wages in s 2 b because of the exception of all kinds of bonus from that definition we are therefore of opinion that production bonus of this type is excluded from the definition of basic wages in p 2 b and therefore the decision of the central government which was presumably under s 19a of the act to remove the difficulty arising a out of giving effect to the provisions of the act by which such a bonus has been included in the definition of basic wages is incorrect in view of this decision it is unnecessary to consider the effect of art 14 in the present case\n",
      "26 we therefore allow the petition and hold that production bonus of the typical kind in force in the company is accepted from the term basic wages and therefore the decision of the central government communicated to the company on march 7 1962 that provident fund contributions must also be made on the production bonus earned by the employees in his company must be set aside as this petition was heard along with petition no64 of 1962 and the main arguments were in that petition we order parties to bear their own costs\n",

      "1  an fir was registered on 2331996 on the statement of one prakashi devi she stated that on the night of 222331996 while she and her daughterinlaw sheela devi were sleeping in her house around 1130 pm the appellant jumped over the front wall of her house and broke the bulbs and ran away that at that time no male member was present in the house except the children that around 0030 am the appellant again came into her house and touched her daughterinlaw sheela devi who woke up and raised an alarm and that the appellant immediately ran away the police investigated into the said complaint and submitted a report us 173 of the code of criminal procedure for short the code on that basis the following charge was framed by the judicial magistrate first class karnal against the appellant \n",
      "that on 2331996 after having made preparation for causing hurt or assault you committed house trespass into the house of smt prakashi devi and thereby committed an offence punishable us 452 ipc within my cognizance secondly on the same date time and place you assaulted and used criminal force against abovenamed prakashi devi with intent to outrage her modesty and thereby committed an offence punishable us 354 ipc and within my cognizance and i hereby direct that you be tried on the above said charge by this court\n",
      "emphasis supplied\n",
      "2 when the said charged was read over and explained to the appellant he pleaded not guilty to the said charge and claimed trial\n",
      "3  prakashi devi was examined as pw1 she reiterated what was recorded in the fir that the appellant came into the house around 1130 pm and broke the bulbs that he came again around 0030 am and touched her daughterinlaw sheela devi and when her daughterinlaw woke up and raised an alarm the appellant ran away in her crossexamination prakashi devi stated that she has five sons that only her husband and one son named mahavir were staying with her that the other four sons were married and were not staying with her that on that night her husband was away in the fields and her son mahavir was also not present in the house however when confronted with her statement recorded in the fir she admitted having stated that when the appellant had come first time at around 1130 pm and broke the outside bulbs her son woke up and went out of the house she also admitted that the appellant did not touch her nor teased her nor abused her her daughterinlaw sheela devi gave evidence as pw2 and stated that she was married to one jaibir who worked in the military services that at 11 to 1130 pm the accused scaled the door and broke the bulbs in the verandah of her house that when she identified the accused and raised an alarm the accused ran away that again he came around 0030 am by scaling the door and caught her hand and that when she raised an alarm and when her motherinlaw woke up he ran away\n",
      "4 it was elicited in her crossexamination that the accused did not go towards her motherinlaw nor say anything to her motherinlaw that she used to come to the village where her inlaws were residing only when her husband came home and that the house of her fatherinlaw was surrounded by the houses of his brothers and their sons both pw1 and pw2 stated that the house of the accused was at a distance of 1516 houses from the house of prakashi devi that the accused had never come into their house earlier that their family and the accused were not on visiting terms with each other even during functions marriages or death though they were on visiting terms with others in the village pw 2 also stated that she did not know the particulars of the dispute between the accused and her inlaws the investigating officer was examined as pw3 the accused examined a witness exsarpanch of the village as dw1 and he stated that there was a quarrel between the accused and complainants son surinder about a water course and subsequently he came to know that the quarrel was converted into a false case against the accused by registering a false allegation that the accused had outraged the modesty of a woman\n",
      "5  the learned magistrate by judgment dated 222001 held the accused guilty of offences uss 452 and 354 crpc and sentenced him for rigorous imprisonment for six months and a fine of rs1000 in default thereof simple imprisonment for one month the appeal filed by the accused was dismissed by the addl sessions judge on 2022002 the criminal revision filed by the appellant was disposed of by the high court on 1632010 upholding the conviction but reducing the sentence from six to four months rigorous imprisonment that order is challenged by the accused\n",
      "6  one of the contentions urged by the accused before the appellate court and high court was that the charge against him was that he attempted to outrage the modesty of prakashi devi pw1 whereas the evidence was to show that he attempted to outrage the modesty of her daughterinlaw sheela devi he contended that as the charge levelled against him was not proved and as he was not required to defend himself against a charge that he assaulted and outraged the modesty of sheela devi he ought to have been acquitted this was negatived by the appellate court and high court holding that an accused cannot take advantage of a technical defect in framing the charge it was held that mentioning the name of prakashi devi instead of the name of sheela devi in the charge was an error that did not prejudice the accused\n",
      "7  the following question therefore arises for our consideration when the charge is that the accused assaulted x and outraged her modesty but the evidence is that he assaulted y to outrage her modesty can the accused be punished for having assaulting and outraging the modesty of y even though he was not charged with any offence with reference to y on the ground that the error or omission in the charge did not prejudice the accused or result in failure of justice\n",

      "9  in willie william slaney vs state of madhya pradesh air 1956 sc 116 1955 indlaw sc 80 this court explained the concepts of prejudice to the accused and failure of justice thus\n",
      "6 before we proceed to set out our answer and examine the provisions of the code we will pause to observe that the code is a code of procedure and like all procedural laws is designed to further the ends of justice and not to frustrate them by the introduction of endless technicalities the object of the code is to ensure that an accused person gets a full and fair trial along certain wellestablished and wellunderstood lines that accord with our notions of natural justice\n",
      "if he does if he is tried by a competent court if he is told and clearly understands the nature of the offence for which he is being tried if the case against him is fully and fairly explained to him and he is afforded a full and fair opportunity of defending himself then provided there is substantial compliance with the outward forms of the law mere mistakes in procedure mere inconsequential errors and omissions in the trial are regarded as venal by the code and the trial is not vitiated unless the accused can show substantial prejudice that broadly speaking is the basic principle on which the code is based\n",
      "7 now here as in all procedural laws certain things are regarded as vital disregard of a provision of that nature is fatal to the trial and at once invalidates the conviction others are not vital and whatever the irregularity they can be cured and in that event the conviction must stand unless the court is satisfied that there was prejudice some of these matters are dealt with by the code and wherever that is the case full effect must be given to its provisions\n",
      "10 this court then examined the question as to when a procedure adopted could be said to have worked actual injustice to the accused and held \n",
      "except where there is something so vital as to cut at the root of jurisdiction or so abhorrent to what one might term natural justice the matter resolves itself to a question of prejudice some violations of the code will be so obvious that they will speak for themselves as for example a refusal to give the accused a hearing a refusal to allow him to defend himself a refusal to explain the nature of the charge to him and so forth\n",
      "these go to the foundations of natural justice and would be struck down as illegal forthwith it hardly matters whether this is because prejudice is then patent or because it is so abhorrent to wellestablished notions of natural justice that a trial of that kind is only a mockery of a trial and not of the kind envisaged by the laws of our land because either way they would be struck down at once\n",
      "other violations will not be so obvious and it may be possible to show that having regard to all that occurred no prejudice was occasioned or that there was no reasonable probability of prejudice in still another class of case the matter may be so near the border line that very slight evidence of a reasonable possibility of prejudice would swing the balance in favour of the accused\n",
      " the code is emphatic that whatever the irregularity it is not to be regarded as fatal unless there is prejudice\n",
      "it is the substance that we must seek courts have to administer justice and justice includes the punishment of guilt just as much as the protection of innocence neither can be done if the shadow is mistaken for the substance and the goal is lost in a labyrinth of unsubstantial technicalities broad vision is required a nice balancing of the rights of the state and the protection of society in general against protection from harassment to the individual and the risks of unjust conviction\n",
      "every reasonable presumption must be made in favour of an accused person he must be given the benefit of every reasonable doubt the same broad principles of justice and fair play must be brought to bear when determining a matter of prejudice as in adjudging guilt but when all is said and done what we are concerned to see is whether the accused had a fair trial whether he knew what he was being tried for whether the main facts sought to be established against him were explained to him fairly and clearly and whether he was given a full and fair chance to defend himself\n",
      "if all these elements are there and no prejudice is shown the conviction must stand whatever the irregularities whether traceable to the charge or to a want of one\n",
      "in adjudging the question of prejudice the fact that the absence of a charge or a substantial mistake in it is a serious lacuna will naturally operate to the benefit of the accused and if there is any reasonable and substantial doubt about whether he was or was reasonably likely to have been misled in the circumstances of any particular case he is as much entitled to the benefit of it here as elsewhere but if on a careful consideration of all the facts prejudice or a reasonable and substantial likelihood of it is not disclosed the conviction must stand also it will always be material to consider whether objection to the nature of the charge or a total want of one was taken at an early stage\n",
      "but these are matters of fact which will be special to each different case and no conclusion on these questions of fact in any one case can ever be regarded as a precedent or a guide for a conclusion of fact in another because the facts can never be alike in any two cases however alike they may seem there is no such thing as a judicial precedent on facts though counsel and even judges are sometimes prone to argue and to act as if there were\n",
      "11 in gurbachan singh v state of punjab air 1957 sc 623 1957 indlaw sc 181 following willie slaney this court held\n",
      "in judging a question of prejudice as of guilt courts must act with a broad vision and look to the substance and not to technicalities and their main concern should be to see whether the accused had a fair trial whether he knew what he was being tried for whether the main facts sought to be established against him were explained to him fairly and clearly and whether he was given a full and fair chance to defend himself\n",

      "the crux of the matter is this \n",
      "would there be occasion for a failure of justice by adopting such a course as to convict an accused of the offence under section 304b ipc when all the ingredients necessary for the said offence have come out in evidence although he was not charged with the said offence a conviction would be valid even if there is any omission or irregularity in the charge provided it did not occasion a failure of justicethe criminal court particularly the superior court should make a close examination to ascertain whether there was really a failure of justice or whether it is only a camouflage\n",
      "one of the cardinal principles of natural justice is that no man should be condemned without being heard audi alteram partem but the law reports are replete with instances of courts hesitating to approve the contention that failure of justice had occasioned merely because a person was not heard on a particular aspect however if the aspect is of such a nature that nonexplanation of it has contributed to penalizing an individual the court should say that since he was not given the opportunity to explain that aspect there was failure of justice on account of noncompliance with the principle of natural justice\n",

      "14  the following principles relating to sections 212 215 and 464 of the code relevant to this case become evident from the said enunciations\n",
      "i the object of framing a charge is to enable an accused to have a clear idea of what he is being tried for and of the essential facts that he has to meet the charge must also contain the particulars of date time place and person against whom the offence was committed as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged\n",
      "ii the accused is entitled to know with certainty and accuracy the exact nature of the charge against him and unless he has such knowledge his defence will be prejudiced where an accused is charged with having committed offence against one person but on the evidence led he is convicted for committing offence against another person without a charge being framed in respect of it the accused will be prejudiced resulting in a failure of justice but there will be no prejudice or failure of justice where there was an error in the charge and the accused was aware of the error such knowledge can be inferred from the defence that is if the defence of the accused showed that he was defending himself against the real and actual charge and not the erroneous charge\n",
      "iii in judging a question of prejudice as of guilt the courts must act with a broad vision and look to the substance and not to the technicalities and their main concern should be to see whether the accused had a fair trial whether he knew what he was being tried for whether the main facts sought to be established against him were explained to him fairly and clearly and whether he was given a full and fair chance to defend himself\n",
      "15  the respondent relied upon the decision of this court in state of himachal pradesh v geeta ram 2000 7 scc 452 2000 indlaw sc 408 in that case the respondent was chargesheeted for an offence us 376 ipc and s 3 of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes prevention of atrocities act 1989 the magistrate committed the case to sessions court which was specified as a special court under the act\n",
      "16 the special court framed a charge only for an offence us 376 ipc and after trial convicted the respondent us 376 ipc and sentenced him to ten years imprisonment the high court set aside the conviction on the technical ground that the trial court had no jurisdiction as it was a special court specified in under the sc  st prevention of atrocities act this court reversed the decision of the high court on the ground that a special court under the act being a sessions court it continued to have jurisdiction to try the case for the offence us 376 ipc that matter was considered us 465 of the code and not relevant on the facts of this case\n",
      "17  as noticed above in this case the charge was that appellant committed trespass into the house of prakashi devi for assaulting prakashi devi and assaulted the said prakashi devi and outraged her modesty the accused concentrated his crossexamination with reference to the said charge and elicited answers showing that he did not assault or outrage the modesty of prakashi devi he did not try to challenge the evidence let in to show that he had tried to outrage the modesty of sheela devi as he was not charged with such an offence the evidence of pw1 and pw2 was that the appellant did not touch or tease or abuse prakashi devi\n",
      "18 their evidence was that he touchedcaught the hand of sheela devi and when she raised an alarm he ran away when the charge was that the accused attempted to commit trespass into the house of prakashi devi with intent to outrage the modesty of prakashi devi the conclusion of the appellate court and the high court that there was no failure of justice if he is punished for the offence of having assaulted sheela devi and outraging her modesty is opposed to principles of fair play and natural justice embodied in sections 211 212 215 and 464 of the code\n",
      "19 when the accused is charged with having entered the house of prakashi devi and assaulted the said prakashi devi with intent to outrage her modesty and when the accused defended himself in regard to the said charge and concentrated on proving that the said charges were not true he cannot be convicted for having assaulted and outraging the modesty of someone else namely sheela devi\n",
      "20  the accused did not have any opportunity to meet or defend himself against the charge that he assaulted sheela devi and outraged her modesty nor did he proceed with his defence on the understanding that he was being charged with having committed the offence with reference to sheela devi one of the fundamental principles of justice is that an accused should know what is the charge against him so that he can build his defence in regard to that charge an accused cannot be punished for committing an offence against y when he is charged with having committed the offence against x and the entire defence of the accused was with reference to charge of having committed offence against x\n",
      "21  the illustrations under a provision of a statute offer relevant and valuable indications as to meaning and object of the provision and are helpful in the working and application of the provision illustration e us 215 of the code as contrasted from illustration d under that section throws some light on this issue the said illustrations are extracted below \n",
      "d a is charged with the murder of khoda baksh on the 21st january 1882 in fact the murdered persons name was haidar baksh and the date of the murder was the 20th january 1882 a was never charged with any murder but one and had heard the inquiry before the magistrate which referred exclusively to the case of haidar baksh the court may infer from these facts that a was not misled and that the error in the charge was immaterial\n",
      "e a was charged with murdering haidar baksh on the 20th january 1882 and khoda baksh who tried to arrest him for that murder on the 21 st january 1882 when charged for the murder of haidar baksh he was tried for the murder of khoda baksh the witnesses present in his defence were witnesses in the case of haidar baksh the court may infer from this that a was misled and that the error was material\n",
      "22 applying the guidance offered by the said illustrations and the legal principles evolved by this court the position will be as follows  if sheela devi alone had been present at the house at the time of the incident and the accused had assaulted and outraged the modesty of the said sheela devi but in the charge the name of the victim had been erroneously mentioned say as sushila devi or prakashi devi though there was no person by such name and the inquiry exclusively referred to the assault and outraging the modesty of sheela devi the court could infer that the accused was not misled and the error in the charge was immaterial\n",
      "23 on the other hand if two persons were present in the house at the time of the incident namely prakashi devi and sheela devi and the accused is charged with trespassing into the house of prakashi devi and assaulting and outraging the modesty of the said prakashi devi and the witnesses refer only to the assault and outraging the modesty of sheela devi the court will have to infer that the accused was prejudiced if the accused had solely concentrated and focused his defence and entire crossexamination to show that he did not commit the offences against prakashi devi\n",
      "24  the court having charged the accused with the offence of having trespassed into the house of prakashi devi with intent to assault her and having further charged him for having assaulted the said prakashi devi by outraging her modesty convicts him on the ground that though he did not assault or outrage the modesty of prakashi devi he had outraged the modesty of sheela devi that would lead to failure of justice there was a material error in the charge as it violated the requirement of subs 1 of s 212 of the code that the charge shall contain particulars as to the person against whom the offence was committed\n",
      "25 there were two women present at the house at the time of the alleged incident namely prakashi devi and her daughterinlaw sheela devi in view of the specific charge the accused concentrated on showing that the charge was false he did not attempt to meet the case made out in the trial that the offence was against sheela devi the accused was thus clearly misled by the error in the charge which caused prejudiced to the accused thereby occasioning failure of justice therefore we are of the view that there should be a new trial after charging him with the offence of outraging the modesty of sheela devi\n",
      "26  the appeal is therefore allowed the conviction of the accused is set aside and the matter is remitted to the trial court with a direction for a new trial after framing a charge by substituting the words her daughterinlaw sheela devi for the words abovenamed prakashi devi in the second part of the charge\n",

      "17 january 1968\n",
      "writ petitions nos 194 196 and 202 of 1967 petitions under art 32 of the constitution of india for the enforcement of fundamental rights and civil appeal no 1456 of 1967 appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated august 16 1967 of the madras high court in writ appeal no 308 of 1967\n",
      "the judgment was delivered by  kailas nath wanchoo j\n",
      "1  the three petitions and the civil appeal challenge the same order of the state of madras by which rules were promulgated for selection of candidates for admission to the first year integrated mbbs course we shall briefly refer to the provisions of the rules to understand the attack made thereon it appears that there was a large rush of candidates for admission to the medical colleges in the state of madras while the seats therein were limited in consequence the state of madras which runs these colleges framed rules for admission to them it is not necessary to refer to all the rules and we shall confine ourselves to those rules which have a bearing on the challenge made in these cases rule 2 provides for reservation of 10 seats for certain categories we are however not concerned with it as it is not challenged rule 3 provides for appointment of a selection committee of not more than three persons the committee has to interview all candidates who are qualified and eligible for admission to the course and the interview is for verifying the data and allotting marks for extra curricular activities rule 4 provides for reservation of seats for scheduled tribes and scheduled castes with which also we are not concerned in the present cases rule 5 which is one of the rules under challenge provides for reservation for socially and educationally backward classes and lays down that for the purpose of this rule socially and educationally backward classes will mean those classes which have been specified in group iii of the revised appendix 17a to the madras educational rules issued with go ms 839 education dated 6th april 1951 as subsequently amended rule 6 provides for reservation for women which is also not under challenge and the remaining seats under r 7 go to the general pool available to all\n",
      "2  rule 8 which is another rule under challenge provides that the seats reserved in the general pool and the seats reserved for the socially and educationally backward classes will be allocated among the various districts on the basis of the ratio of the population of each districts to the total population of the state this district wise allocation will not apply to seats reserved for scheduled tribes and scheduled castes provided under r 5 then follows r 9 as to the procedure for selection and qualifications of candidates rule 10d provides for a maximum of 75 marks for extra curricular activities which have been specified under five heads further the rules also prescribe the form of application and as the selection is on a district wise basis the form has a column to the effect nativity claimed it further appears from the form that nativity depends on the sslc register ie the district from which the candidate passed the sslc examination or on the nativity certificate of parents further for the purpose of nativity the place where the candidates parents were born or the place where they possessed immovable property has to be considered the candidate may choose the district from which he passed the sslc examination but he may in the alternative choose some other district on the ground of nativity and this choice leaves it open to him to choose the district of permanent residence of the father or the mother further the form of certificate shows that where the parents are dead even the guardians nativity can be the basis of the district which a candidate may claim\n",
      "3  on the basis of these rules a number of selection committees were appointed each consisting of three members it is not in dispute that the three members of the selection committee did not sit together to interview candidates each member was allotted 25 marks out of the total of 75 prescribed for the interview and interviewed each candidate separately this method of selection has also been attacked as against the rules\n",
      "4  four main contentions have been raised before us in these cases it has been urged that r 5 which provides for reservation for socially and educationally backward classes is bad as it violates art 15 of the constitution on the ground that it is based entirely on consideration of caste the second attack is on the district wise allocation under r 8 on the ground that it violates arts 14 and 15 it is urged that in effect the selection is made to a large extent on the basis of the place of birth and this violates art 15 it is also urged that district wise allocation of seats for medical colleges is discriminatory for such allocation has no nexus with the object of selection namely to secure the best talent for admission to medical colleges thirdly it is urged that the procedure evolved by the selection committee for interview which we have already referred to was in violation of the rules it is also urged that there was no objective test laid down in the rules for interview and the questions that were put were unrelated to r 10d which lays down certain criteria for the purpose lastly it is urged that the selection was mala fide inasmuch as the two official members contrived to secure caste representation in the matter of admission\n",
      "5  the petitions have been opposed on behalf of state of madras as also the civil appeal it has been urged that there is no substance in any of the contentions raised in these cases it is unnecessary to refer to the stand taken by the state of madras in detail at this stage for it will appear at appropriate places when we consider the various points raised in these cases\n",
      "6  before we consider the points raised in these cases we may refer to a preliminary objection raised on behalf of the respondents it is urged that the selected candidates whose number is in the neighbourhood of 1100 have not been made parties in these cases and therefore the cases should be rejected on that ground alone learned counsel for the petitioners appellant however accepted that so far as the present selections are concerned they would not press for quashing them for in any case it would be too late for these petitionersappellaiit to get admission in medical colleges this year they therefore pray that the points raised may be decided for the future and the selection made this year may not be disturbed on that basis it is urged on behalf of the petitioners and the appellant that it would not be necessary to make the candidates selected for this year parties in view of this statement at the bar we propose to decide the points raised in these cases but shall not disturb the selections made this year\n",
      "7  the first challenge is to r 5 on the ground that it violates art 15 of the constitution art 15 forbids discrimination against any citizen on the grounds only of religion race caste sex place of birth or any of them at the same time art 15 4 inter alia permits the state to make any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens\n",
      "8  the contention is that the list of socially and educationally backward classes for whom reservation is made under r 5 nothing but a list of certain castes therefore reservation in favour of certain castes based only on caste considerations violates art 151 which prohibits discrimination on the ground of caste only now if the reservation in question bad been based only on caste and had not taken into account the social and educational backwardness of the caste in question it would be violative of art 151 but it must not be forgotten that a caste is also a class of citizens and if the caste is a whole is socially and educationally backward reservation can be made in favour of such a caste on the around that it is a socially and educationally backward class of citizens within the meaning of art 154 reference in this connection may be made to the observations of this court in m r balaji v state of mysore 1963 supp 1 scr 439 1962 indlaw sc 272 at p 459460 to the effect that it was not irrelevant to consider the caste of a class of citizens in determining their social and educational backwardness it was further observed that though the caste of a class of citizens may be relevant its importance should not be exaggerated and if classification of backward classes of citizens was based solely on the caste of the citizen it might be open to objection it is true that in the present cases the list of socially and educationally backward classes has been specified by caste but that does not necessarily mean that caste was the sole consideration and that persons belonging to these castes are also not a class of socially and educationally backward citizens in its reply the state of madras has given the history as to how this list of backward classes was made starting from the year 1906 and how the list has been kept up to date and necessary amendments made therein it has also been stated that the main criterion for inclusion in the list was the social and educational backwardness of the caste based on occupations pursued by these castes because the members of the caste as a whole were found to be socially and educationally backward they were put in the list the matter was finally examined after the constitution came into force in the light of the provisions contained in art 154 as it was found that members of these castes as a whole were educationally and socially backward the list which had been coming on from as far back as 1906 was finally adopted for purposes of art 15 4 in short the case of the state of madras is that the castes included in the list are only a compendious indication of the class of people in those castes and these classes of people had been put in the list for the purpose of art 154 because they had been found to be socially and educationally backward\n",
      "9  this is the position as explained in the affidavit filed on behalf of the state of madras on the other hand the only thing stated in the petitions is that as the list is based on caste alone it is violative of art 151 in view however of the explanation given by the state of madras which has not been controverted by any rejoinder it must be accepted that though the list shows certain castes the members of those castes are really classes of educationally and socially backward citizens  no attempt was made on behalf of the petitionersappellant to show that any caste mentioned in this list was not educationally and socially backward no such averment was made in the affidavit in support of their cases nor was any attempt made to traverse the case put forward on behalf of the state of madras by filing a rejoinder affidavit to show that even one of the castes included in the list was not educationally and socially backward in this state of the pleadings we must come to the conclusion that though the list is prepared castewise the castes included therein are as a whole educationally and socially backward and therefore the list is not violative of art 15 the challenge to r 5 must the next attack is on r 8 which provides for district wise distribution of seats according to population of the district this is attacked first on the ground that it violates art 15 1 which lays down that there shall be no discrimination on the basis of place of birth and it is urged that the provision for nativity claimed in the form is really a camouflage for discriminating on the ground of place of birth we have already referred to the provisions relating to nativity certificate we must say that these provisions are as complicated and confusing as possible and there may be some force in the contention raised that this has been done to get over the prohibition in art 151 with respect to discrimination on the basis of place of birth what exactly nativity means is not clear from the rule it may be the place from where the candidate passed his sslc examination it may be the place where his lather was born or his mother was born it may be the place where his father has property or his mother has property or it may be the place of permanent residence of the parents or guardian for the words permanent residence appear in the form of nativity certificate but the dictionary meaning of the word  nativity is birth and when the rules provide for nativity certificate they really mean the place of birth however it appears that the place of birth of the candidate is nowhere mentioned in the rules even though there may be some substance in the charge that all this complicated and confusing method has been provided in order to get over the prohibition in art 151 by a camouflage we cannot say that there is a clear violation of art 151 for the district which the candidate may claim does not depend upon the place of his birth we cannot therefore strike down r 8 on the ground that it discriminates on the basis of place of birth of the candidate concerned\n",
      "10  in the alternative it is urged that districtwise distribution violates art 14 of the constitution because it denies equality before the law or equal protection of the laws inasmuch as such allocation of seats may result in candidates of inferior calibre being selected in one district while candidates of superior calibre cannot be selected in another district it has not been denied on behalf of the state that such a thing cannot happen though there are no statistics available in this behalf because the marksheets were all destroyed after the interviews the question whether district wise allocation is violative of art 14 will depend on what is the object to be achieved in the matter of admission to medical colleges considering the fact that there is a larger number of candidates than seats available selection has got to be made the object of selection can only be to secure the best possible material for admission to colleges subject to the provision for socially and educationally backward classes further whether selection is from the socially and educationally backward classes or from the general pool the object of selection must be to secure the best possible talent from the two sources if that is the object it must necessarily follow that that object would be defeated if seats are allocated district by district it cannot be and has not been denied that the object of selection is to secure the best possible talent from the two sources so that the country may have the best possible doctors if that is the object the argument on behalf of the petitionersappellant is that that object cannot possibly be served by allocating seats district wise it is true that art 14 does not forbid classification but the classification has to be justified on the basis of the nexus between the classification and the object to be achieved even assuming that territorial classification may be a reasonable classification the fact however that the classification by itself is reasonable is not enough to support it unless there is nexus between the classification and the object to be achieved therefore as the object to be achieved in a case of the kind with which we are concerned is to get the best talent for admission to professional colleges the allocation of seats district wise has no reasonable relation with the object to be achieved if anything such allocation will result in many cases in the object being destroyed and if that is so the classification even if reasonable would result in discrimination inasmuch as better qualified candidates from one district may be rejected while less qualified candidates from other districts may be admitted from either of the two sources\n",
      "11  let us now look to the justification which has been put forward on behalf of the state of madras in support of this district wise allocation it is said that there are better educational facilities in madras city as compared to other districts of the state and therefore if district wise selection is not made candidates from madras city would have an advantage and would secure many more seats than justified on the basis of proportion of the population of madras city compared to the population of the state as a whole this in our opinion is no justification for district wise allocation which results in discrimination even assuming that candidates from madras city will get a larger number of seats in proportion to the population of the state that would happen because a candidate from madras city is better if the object is to attract the best talent from the two sources district wise allocation in the circumstances would destroy that object further even if we were to accept this contention that would only justify allocation of seats between the city of madras on one side and the rest of the state on the other and not a district wise allocation throughout but apart from this we are of opinion that the object being what we have indicated there is no reason why there should be discrimination which would go against the candidates from madras city we may add that candidates who pass from madras city need not all be residents of the city for it is common knowledge that schools and colleges in the capital city attract students from all over the state because of better educational facilities\n",
      "12  another justification that has been attempted is that candidates coming from various districts would settle down in those districts and thus medical help would be available in sufficient measure in all the districts now this was not stated in the affidavit on behalf of the state of madras besides there are no facts and figures to suggest that candidates from a particular district would by and large settle down in that district further the various options in the matter of nativity certificate to which we have referred show that candidates will have a number of districts to choose from depending upon where they think that their chances are best and therefore the argument that districtwise allocation is justifiable on this ground is in our opinion of no merit we are satisfied therefore that the state of madras has made out no case for district wise allocation of seats in medical colleges we are also satisfied that such allocation results in discrimination and there is no nexus between this territorial distribution and the object to be achieved namely admission of the best talent from the two sources already indicated we are therefore of opinion that allocation of seats on district wise basis is violative of art 14 we may add that we do not mean to say that territorial classification is always bad under all circumstances but there is no doubt that district wise classification which is being justified on a territorial basis in these cases is violative of art 14 for no justification worth the name in support of the classification has been made out we therefore hold that r 8 providing for district wise allocation is bad as it violates art 14 and we hereby strike it down\n",
      "13  in view of our decision as to r 8 and in view of the fact that there is no question of disturbing the selection made this year we do not think it necessary to decide finally whether the procedure for selection followed in the present cases to which we have already referred is in accordance with the rules or not all that we need say is that it certainly looks odd that the members of the selection committee should sit separately but we do not propose to decide the point finally in the present cases we do not find any substance in the argument that there is no test provided for marking rule 10d indicates what matters have to be taken into consideration for allotting marks provided under that rule we do not think that it is possible to provide any further guidance in the matter and the rest must be left to the selection committee it may be added that we are not prepared to accept that the committee did not follow the criterion indicated in r 10d in allotting the marks provided in that rule\n",
      "14  this leaves the question of mala fide only two points are urged in this connection the first is that the official members of the selection committees contrived to get caste representation in the matter of selection at the behest of the government there is in our opinion no proof of this and we are not prepared to accept that this was done the second point in support of mala fides is that marksheets were destroyed after the selection was over it does look odd that marksheets were so destroyed and we should have thought that marksheets would be kept for some period at any rate after the selection was over but from this it is not possible to infer that the selection itself was mala fide moreover the attack on the selection on the ground of mala fides will affect the current selection only and therefore in view of the stand taken at the bar by the petitioners this ground does not now avail them the ground that the selection was mala fide must therefore fail we now come to the civil appeal\n",
      "15 learned counsel for the appellant wished to raise an argument based on art 21 which deals with protection of life and personal liberty apart from the question whether admission to professional colleges results in deprivation of life and liberty we did not allow learned counsel to develop this point because no such case was made out before the division bench of the high court which heard the appeal we told learned counsel that he could argue only those points which had been urged before the division bench the only point urged before the division bench was on the basis of a provision in the university act as to eligibility and qualification of candidates for admission to medical colleges there is however no substance in the contention raised in this behalf for the rules as to eligibility and qualification as framed by the university have been followed so far as admission is concerned it has to be made by those who are in control of the colleges in this case the government because the medical colleges are government colleges affiliated to the university in these circumstances the government was entitled to frame rules for admission to medical colleges controlled by it subject to the rules of the university as to eligibility and qualifications this was what was done in these cases and therefore the selection cannot be challenged on the ground that it was not in accordance with the university act and the rules framed there under\n",
      "16  we therefore partly allow the petitions and strike down rule 8 of the rules for admission to medical colleges which deals with district wise allocation the appeal is also allowed to the same extent we have already indicated that so far as the selection for the current year is concerned it will stand however r 8 will not be enforced when selection is made hereafter the petitionersappellant will get their costs one set of hearing fee\n",

      "appeal civil  488 of 1957\n",
      "the judgment was delivered by b p sinha j\n",
      "1 the main question for determination in this appeal by special leave is whether the provisions of art 311 2 of the constitution are applicable to a probationer in the bihar subordinate civil service who has been discharged as unsuitable on grounds of notoriety for corruption and unsatisfactory work in the discharge of his public duties\n",
      "2 the facts of this case are short and simple the respondent was appointed as a temporary subdeputy collector in the year 1944 in 1946 he was vested with the powers of a magistrate of the first class in december 1947 he was appointed to a substantive post in the bihar subordinate civil service on probation during the period of his probation he was posted at jamshedpur in the district of singhbhum and later at nawada in the district of gaya proceedings were taken against him and he was called upon to show cause why his services should not be terminated forthwith by the government letter dated 4 november 1952 a copy of which was forwarded to the respondent through the district magistrate gaya in that letter it was stated that throughout the year 1948 and upon the end of may 1949 the respondent while employed as a subdeputy magistrate at jamshedpur had earned notoriety for corrupt practices that from may 1949 to march 1951 the respondents reputation while posted at nawada continued to be bad and that his judicial work while at jamshedpur had been subjected to careful scrutiny by government leading to discovery of incredibly perverse decisions given by him instances of eight cases with all the necessary details were also recited therein those proceedings terminated in an order of the government of bihar dated 23 july 1953 the relevant portions of which are as follows\n",
      "1 certain facts were brought to the notice of government about the unsatisfactory work and conduct of mr gopi kishore prasad subdeputy collector on probation while posted at jamshedpur and nawada which raised grave doubts regarding his integrity and indicated that he was a corrupt and unreliable officer confidential enquires were made and it was found that while employed at jamshedpur mr gopi kishore prasad had the reputation of being a corrupt officer two successive deputy commissioner of singhbhum under whom mr prasad had served had also mentioned in their annual confidential reports that this officer had a bad reputation at jamshedpur the judicial work of mr prasad while at jamshedpur was subjected to a careful scrutiny and government found ample materials to show that the reports about his resorting to corrupt practices were justified he was transferred to nawada both the district magistrate gaya and commissioner patna division reported that the nawada mr gopi kishore prasads honesty was open to doubt he was then transferred to gaya his work at gaya was found to be wholly unsatisfactory\n",
      "2 in consideration of all these facts it was provisionally decided to terminate the probation of mr gopi kishore prasad and discharge him from service he was accordingly asked to show cause against his discharge his explanation was carefully considered by government and found to be unsatisfactory\n",
      "3 in view of these facts government have after consulting the public service commission been pleased to order that mr gopi kishore prasad should be discharged from service forthwith\n",
      "4 mr gopi kishore prasad probationary subdeputy collector is therefore discharged from service with effect from the date on which this order is served on him\n",
      "order\n",
      "ordered that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the district magistrate gaya for service on mr gopi kishore prasad\n",
      "by order of the government of bihar sd b n sinha 24753 deputy secretary to government\n",
      "3 the respondent moved the high court of judicature at patna under arts 226 and 227 of the constitution against the order of the government quoted above the matter was heard by v ramaswami j as he then was and k sahai j the high court by its judgment dated 19 january 1955 allowed the application and quashed the order aforesaid of the government dated 23 july 1953 ramaswami j with all the contentions raised on behalf of the respondentpetitioner in the high court  and after examining the relevant rules of the civil services classification control and appeal rules and art 3112 of the constitution came to the conclusion that the respondent was not entitled to a full enquiry as contemplated by the para 1 of rule 55 of the civil service classification control and appeal rules but that he was entitled to the protection under art 3112 of the constitution he also held that there had been a violation of the principles of natural justice inasmuch as the special reports of the commissioner of chotanagpur division and of the deputy inspectorgeneral of police in the criminal investigation department had not been shown to the respondent on these grounds he held that the order of discharge impugned by the respondent was illegal and ultra vires sahai j did not express a decided opinion on the question whether the respondent was entitled to the protection of art 3112 of the constitution because in his view the decision of the judicial committee of the privy council in i m lall case lr 75 ia 225 1948 indlaw pc 32 was concerned with a confirmed officer whereas the respondent was only an officer on probation but he agreed with ramaswami j in the result on the ground of the violation of the principles of natural justicethe state of bihar moved the high court for leave to appeal to this court the application for leave under art 1321 of the constitution was heard by s k das cj as the then was and kanhaiya singh j the high court by its order dated 8 august 1955 refused to grant the leave on the ground that the case had not really been determined on an interpretation of art 311 of the constitution but substantially on the ground that there had been an infringement of the principles of natural justice the state of bihar thereafter moved this court for special leave to appeal which was granted on 28 november 1955 that is how the matter had come before this court\n",
      "4 the main point in controversy before us turns on the question whether the provisions of art 3112 of the constitution are attracted to the case of a public servant who was still a probationer and had not been confirmed in a substantive post the question whether there had or had not been a violation of the principles of natural justice which was the basis of the decision in the high court as indicated above was not raised before us\n",
      "5 the judgment of the high court could be allowed to rest on that basis alone but as it appears that this court granted special leave to determine the controversy based upon the interpretation of art 3112 of the constitution we think it necessary to express our opinion on that part of the case the decision of this court in parshotam lal dhingra v union of india 1958 1 llj 544 1957 indlaw sc 103 had not been given till then if that decision were in existence then perhaps the special leave would not have been granted\n",
      "in our opinion the controversy raised in this case is completely covered by the decision of the constitution bench of this court in dhingra case 1957 indlaw sc 103 supra the main question for decision in that case was whether the appellant dhingra had been reduced in rank by way of punishment as a result of the order of the general manager of the railway though in that case this court decided that the order impugned had got that effect this court went elaborately into all the implications of the service conditions with particular reference to the railway service rules and the constitutional provisions contained in s240 of the government of india act 1935 and art 311 of the constitution the elaborate discussion in that judgment has reference to all stages of employment in the public services including temporary posts probationers as also confirmed officers in so far as those observations have a bearing on the termination of service or discharge of a probationary public servant they may be summarized as follows\n",
      "1 appointment to a post on probation gives to the person so appointed no right to the post and his service may be terminated without taking recourse to the proceedings laid down in the relevant rules for dismissing a public servant or removing him from service\n",
      "2 the termination of employment of a person holding a post on probation without any enquiry whatsoever cannot be said to deprive him of any right to a post and is therefore no punishment\n",
      "3 but if instead of terminating such a persons service without any enquiry the employer chooses to hold an enquiry into his alleged misconduct or inefficiency of for some similar reason the termination of service is by way of punishment because it puts a stigma on his competence and thus affects his future career in such a case he is entitled to the protection of art 3112 of the constitution\n",
      "4 in the lastmentioned case if the probationer is discharged on any one of those grounds without a proper enquiry and without his getting a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against his discharge it will amount to a removal from service within the meaning of art 3112 of the constitution and will therefore be liable to be struck down\n",
      "5 but if the employer simply terminates the services of a probationer without holding an enquiry and without giving him a reasonable chance of showing cause against his removal from service probationary civil servant can have no cause of action even though the real motive behind the removal from service may have been that his employer thought him to be unsuitable for the post he was temporarily holding on account of his misconduct or inefficiency or some such cause\n",
      "6 it would thus appear that in the instant case thought the respondent was only a probationer he was discharged from service really because the government had on enquiry come to the conclusion rightly or wrongly that he was unsuitable for the post he held on probation this was clearly by way of punishment and therefore he was entitled to the protection of art 3112 of the constitution it was argued on behalf of the appellant that the respondent being a mere probationer could be discharged without any enquiry into his conduct being made and his discharge could not mean any punishment to him because he had no right to a post it is true if the government came to the conclusion that the respondent was not a fit and proper person to hold a post in the public service of the state it could discharge him without holding any enquiry into his alleged misconduct if the government proceeded against him in that direct way without casting any aspersion on his honesty or competance his discharge would not in law have the effect of a removal from service by way of punishment and he would therefore have no grievance to ventilate in any court instead of taking that easy course the government chose the more difficult one of starting proceedings against him and of branding him as a dishonest and an incompetent officer he had the right in those circumstances to insist upon the protection of art 311 2 of the constitution that protection not having been given to him he had the right to seek his redress in court\n",
      "7 it must therefore be held that the respondent had been wrongly deprived of the protection afforded by art 3112 of the constitution his removal from the service therefore was not in accordance with the requirements of the constitutionthe appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs\n",

      "1 a fond hope that a decision of this court with the sanction of art 141 of the constitution that the law laid down therein will be the law of the land would put an end to a raging controversy amongst various high courts stands to some extent rudely shaken when the controversy with a slight variation has again been placed in the lap of this court for highlighting and then resolving the controversy facts in dispute have a little or no relevance save and except mentioning certain events respondent yadav engineer  contractor a partnership firm filed a suit against food corporation of india 1st defendant and shyam narain nigam district manager of 1st defendant as 2nd defendant for a declaration that the contract between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant for handling and transportation of the goods of the 1st defendant corporation was subsisting on the date of the suit and restraining the defendant from committing breach of the same by handing over that work to some one other than the plaintiff the suit was instituted on 1 june 1981 in the court of the iii civil judge class i gwalior in the suit a notice of motion was taken out purporting to be under order xxxix rules 1 and 2 read with s 151 of the code of civil procedure for an interim injunction restraining the defendants from committing a breach of contract and from interfering with the work of handling and transport of goods of the 1st defendant corporation by the plaintiff during the pendency of the suit on the notice of motion being taken out the court directed notice of the same to be served and the same was made returnable on the next day 2 june 1981 on the returnable date the 2nd defendant district manager of the 1st defendant corporation who had office in the city of gwalior was served and he appeared through one shri nk modi advocate filed the letter of authority vakalat in favour of the learned advocate on behalf of 2nd defendant and the learned advocate prayed for time for reply and arguments to the plaintiffs application for temporary injunction\n",
      "2 the court acceded to the request and posted the matter on 3 june 1981 an endorsement appears in the record that the 1st defendant food corporation of india was not served though the endorsement reads absent however the last line in the proceeding makes it clear that the case was posted on 3 june 1981 for reply arguments and awaiting service on 3 june 1981 when the matter came up on the next day ie 3 june 1981 an application was moved on behalf of 1st defendant inviting the attention of the court to the subsisting arbitration agreement between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant and which agreement authorised the managing director of the 1st defendant to appoint an arbitrator in respect of any dispute arising out of the contract between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant it was also stated that the 1st defendant desires to have the dispute if any resolved by arbitration under the subsisting arbitration agreement and that the defendant is fully ready and willing ichhuk to go to arbitration the application concluded with a prayer that under the circumstances the suit may be stayed as provided in s 34 of the arbitration act 1940 act for short\n",
      "3 the learned trial judge was of the view that the dispute between the parties is covered by the arbitration agreement set out in art 19 of the contract between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant the learned judge negatived the contention that an application made by the 2nd defendant for filing reply to the notice of motion taken out by the plaintiff for interim injunction is a step taken in the proceedings in view of the binding decision of a division bench of the madhya pradesh high court in sansar chand deshraj v state of madhya pradesh the learned judge accordingly granted stay of further proceedings in the suit as prayed for on behalf of the 1st defendant plaintiff preferred an appeal in the court of the district judge gwalior the learned iii additional district judge before whom the appeal came up for hearing agreed with the view taken by the learned trial judge and confirmed the order granting stay of further proceedings in the suit and dismissed the appeal undaunted even by this second rejection plaintiff approached the high court in revision under s 115 of the code of civil procedure the learned judge though his attention was drawn to the binding decision of the division bench of the same high court did not refer to it in the judgment and relied upon a decis ion of the adhara pradesh high court in bajaj international v indian tobacco suppliers 1977 indlaw ap 122 and held that an application for filing reply to a notice of motion for interim injunction is a step taken in the proceeding which would disentitle the party from invoking the arbitration agreement in support of this conclusion the learned judge also relied upon abdul qudoos v abdul gani which decision clearly does not support any such proposition\n",
      "4 the learned judge further observed that even if the view that the application filed by the 2nd defendant praying for time to reply to the notice of motion for interim injunction may not be treated as a step in the proceeding yet the 1st defendant would not be entitled to a discretionary order under s 34 of the act on the ground that one of the conditions necessary for invoking the jurisdiction of the court under s 34 is not satisfied inasmuch as nowhere in the application the 1st defendant has stated that the 1st defendant at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration for this additional reason which was never urged on behalf of the plaintiff either in the trial court or in the 1st appellate court and as would be presently pointed out which is contrary to the record the high court interfered in revision set aside the order of the trial court granting stay and confirmed by the appellate court and rejected the application for stay of proceedings in the suit hence this appeal by special leave s 34 of the act reads as under \n",
      "34 where any party to an arbitration agreement or any person claiming under him commences any legal proceedings against any other party to the agreement or any person claiming under him in respect of any matter agreed to be referred any party to such legal proceedings may at any time before filing a written statement or taking any other steps in the proceedings apply to the judicial authority before which the proceedings are pending to stay the proceedings and if satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred in accordance with the arbitration agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary to the proper conduct of the arbitration such authority may make an order staying the proceedings\n",
      "5 the contours of the controversy are confined to one of the negative requirements of s 34 to be fulfilled by a party seeking the discretionary relief of stay of proceedings to qualify for the same it is not necessary to reproduce all the relevant conditions for attracting the application of s 34 one of the conditions to be satisfied before an order under s 34 can be obtained is that the party to the legal proceeding has at any time before filing a written statement or taking any other steps in the proceedings applied to the judicial authority for stay of proceedings in other words a party seeking stay of proceedings must move the court with an application under s 34 before filing the written statement to the suit or before taking any other steps in the proceedings admittedly application in the present proceedings was filed before filing the written statement the question is whether the second precondition is satisfied in that the application under s 34 was filed before taking any other steps in the proceedings what does the expression before taking any other steps in the proceedings signify before ascertaining the scope and ambit of the expression it would be worthwhile to briefly narrate the raison detre for prescribing this condition\n",
      "ordinarily as provided in s 9 of the code of civil procedure all suits of a civil nature except suits of which cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred would be triable by the courts set up for the purpose if the dispute is of a civil nature the forum is one or the other court set up for the purpose the state courts have been set up for an easy access by persons who seek resolution of their disputes they must be disputes of civil nature and the cognizance of which is not either expressly or impliedly barred civil courts set up by the state having defined jurisdiction will be the forum for resolution of such disputes ordinarily therefore whenever a dispute of a civil nature arises the party claiming relief would approach the court having jurisdiction to resolve the dispute the party against whom relief is sought will be informed of the cognizance of the dispute being taken by the court and it must come forth and either concede that the dispute is genuine in whole or in part or defend the action\n",
      "6 sometimes a dispute as to jurisdiction territorial or pecuniary is raised but apart from such specific exclusions claimed by a party civil courts are set up with the object of resolving civil disputes a forum thus may readily be available and presumed to be easily accessible this is the prescribed mode of access to justice arbitration act carves out an exception to the general rule that the forum for resolution of civil disputes is the civil court having jurisdiction to deal with the same by providing that the parties to a dispute by agreement unto themselves may choose a forum of their choice for settlement of disputes between them in preference to the state courts undoubtedly for making these agreements enforceable sanction of law is necessary that is the object underlying the act industrial revolution bringing into existence international commercial transactions led to a search for finding a forum outside the municipal law courts involving protracted and dilatory legal process for simple uninhibited by intricate rules of evidence and legal grammar this explains resort to forums for arbitration at international level no two contracting parties are under any legal obligation to provide for an arbitration agreement if the parties enter into an arbitration agreement implying that they would like that the disputes covered by the agreement will be resolved by a forum of their choice the approach of the court must be that parties to the contract are held to their bargain if in breach or derogation of a solemn contract a party to an arbitration agreement approaches the court and if the other side expeditiously approaches the court invoking the courts jurisdiction to stay the proceedings so that by this negative process the court forces the parties to abide by the bargain ordinarily the courts approach should be and has been to enforce agreements rather than to find loopholes therein more often it is found that solemn contracts are entered into on the clearest understanding that any dispute arising out of the contract and covered by the contract shall be referred to arbitration it may be that one or the other party may not have entered into the contract in the absence of an arbitration agreement therefore when in breach of an arbitration agreement a party to the agreement rushes to the court unless a clear case to the contrary is made out the approach of the court should be to hold parties to their bargain provided necessary conditions for invoking s 34 are satisfied\n",
      "7 arbitration act prescribes various methods by which an arbitration agreement can be enforced s 20 enables parties to an arbitration agreement to approach the court in the circumstances therein mentioned for a direction that the agreement be filed in the court and on such agreement being filed the court is empowered to make an order of reference to the arbitrator provisions of chapter iv provide for arbitration in suits s 34 prescribes one other method of enforcing arbitration agreement if a party to an arbitration agreement in breach of it approaches the court and files a suit in respect of a dispute covered by the arbitration agreement\n",
      "8 s 34 prescribes a method by which the other party to the arbitration agreement by satisfying the conditions prescribed in s 34 can enforce the arbitration agreement by obtaining an order of stay of the suit it is crystal clear that once the suit is stayed the party who in breach of the arbitration agreement approaches the court for relief will be forced to go to arbitration and thus the court by this negative attitude of declining to proceed further with the proceedings brought before it would enforce the arbitration agreement in order therefore to satisfy the court that the other party to the arbitration agreement who would be defendant in the suit is ready and willing to abide by the arbitration agreement and ready to take all steps necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration it must show that it is not waiving or abandoning its right under the arbitration agreement or submitting to the jurisdiction of the court thereby accepting the forum selected by the plaintiff for resolution of dispute and acquiescing in it in order to steer clear of this charge the provision is made in s 34 for an application by the party who is brought to the court by the opposite party in breach of the arbitration agreement to apply for stay before filing the written statement or before taking any other steps in the proceeding this explains the purpose and object underlying the provision contained in s 34\n",
      "9 the contention and the resultant issue in dispute must now be neatly framed the primary issue is what action on the part of the defendant who is sued in a court of law and who has a subsisting valid arbitration agreement with the plaintiff would constitute step in the proceeding so as to disentitle him to stay of the suit which if granted would enable him to enforce the arbitration agreement  would entering an appearance and contesting petition or notice of motion for interlocutory order constitute such step in the suit or proceedings as would disentitle the party to an order under s 34  the subsidiary point is whether where in a suit filed in a court a prayer for an ex parte ad interim injunction is made either by an application or by a notice of motion or an application is made for appointment of a receiver and either ex parte ad interim injunction is granted or ex parte receiver is appointed and the copies of the pleadings and the order are served upon the defendant if the defendant appears and requests the court either to vacate the injunction or discharge the receiver or modify the orders without filing a written statement or making an application for filing a written statement to the plaint could he be said to have taken a step in the proceedings so as to disentitle him from obtaining stay of the suit \n",
      "10 let the precedents rest for the time being and let an attempt be made to ascertain the underlying intendment in enacting the condition in s 34 which prescribes a mode of enforcing the arbitration agreement to the effect that if a party to an arbitration agreement commences an action the other party to the agreement if it desires to enforce the agreement may seek stay of the suit before either filing written statement or taking other steps in the proceeding ordinarily the court would respect the sanctity of contracts a valid arbitration agreement between the parties obliges both the parties to the agreement to act according to the terms of the agreement a valid arbitration agreement envisages resolution of dispute by a forum of the choice of the parties and displaces the state courts ordinarily a party to a valid arbitration agreement is not entitled unilaterally to commit a breach of the agreement or ignore the agreement now if a party to an arbitration agreement has a dispute to be resolved arising out of the contract in which the arbitration agreement is incorporated and instead of invoking the arbitration agreement by inviting the parties to appoint the arbitrator it rushes to the court in breach of the agreement and files a suit the other party is undoubtedly entitled to enforce the agreement\n",
      "true the other party is equally entitled to waive the benefit of the arbitration agreement if the other party desires to waive the benefit of the agreement it can appear in the suit and contact the suit such conduct would demonstrably show that both the parties have waived the benefit flowing from the arbitration agreement of getting the dispute between them resolved by a forum of their choice but if the first party in breach of the agreement files a suit the other party to the agreement must have an option and opportunity to enforce the arbitration agreement s 34 prescribes a mode and method of enforcing the arbitration agreement when a party to the agreement has filed a suit in breach of the agreement and the other party to the agreement is dragged to the court by staying the suit at the instance of the other party so dragged to the court the first party consequently would be forced to honour the arbitration agreement but before the other party to the arbitration agreement is entitled to enforce the arbitration agreement by stay of the suit it must disclose its unequivocal intention to abide by the agreement and therefore s 34 obliges such a party to ask for stay of the proceedings before such a party takes any steps which may unequivocally indicate the intention to waive the benefit of the arbitration agreement abandonment of a right to seek resolution of dispute as provided in the arbitration agreement must be clearly manifested by the step taken by such party once such unequivocal intention is declared or abandonment of the right to claim the benefit of the agreement becomes manifest from the conduct such party would then not be entitled to enforce the arbitration agreement because there is thus a breach of the agreement by both the parties disentitling both to claim any benefit of the arbitration agreement\n",
      "11 s 34 provides that a party dragged to the court as defendant by another party who is a party to the arbitration agreement must ask for stay of the proceedings before filling the written statement or before taking any other step in the proceedings that party must simultaneously show its readiness and willingness to do all things necessary to the proper conduct of the arbitration the legislature by making it mandatory on the party seeking benefit of the arbitration agreement to apply for stay of the proceedings before filing the written statement or before taking any other steps in the proceedings unmistakably pointed out that filing of the written statement discloses such conduct on the part of the party as would unquestionably show that the party has abandoned its rights under the arbitration agreement and has disclosed an unequivocal intention to accept the forum of the court for resolution of the dispute by waiving its right to get the dispute resolved by a forum contemplated by the arbitration agreement when the party files written statement to the suit it discloses its defence enters into a contest and invites the court to adjudicate upon the dispute once the court is invited to adjudicate upon the dispute there is no question of then enforcing an arbitration agreement by forcing the parties to resort to the forum of their choice as set out in the arbitration agreement this flows from the well settled principle that the court would normally hold the parties to the bargain check ramaji dayawala  sons p ltd v invest import\n",
      "12 apart from filing written statement what other step did the legislature contemplate as being taken in the proceedings which would disentitle the party to the suit from obtaining stay of the proceedings which would have the effect of enforcing the arbitration agreement  general words taking any other steps in the proceedings just follow the specific expression filing a written statement and both are used for achieving the same purpose therefore the latter general expression must be construed ejusdem generis with the specific expression just preceding to bring out the ambit of the latter expression written statement is a term of specific connotation ordinarily signifying a reply to the plaint filed by the plaintiff therefore the expression written statement in s 34 signifies a specific thing namely filing an answer on merits to the plaint filed by the plaintiff this specific word is followed by general words taking any other steps in the proceedings the principle of ejusdem generls must help in finding out the import of the general words because it is a well established rule in the construction of statutes that general terms following particular ones apply to such persons or things as are ejusdem generis with these comprehended in the language of the legislature in ashbury railway carriage  iran co v riche the question of construction of the object of a company to carry on business of mechanical engineers and general contractors came in for consideration and it was said that the generality of the expression general contractors was limited to the previous words mechanical engineers on the principle of ejusdem generis filing of the written statement would disentitle the party from seeking enforcement of arbitration agreement by obtaining stay of proceedings because it is such an act on behalf of the party entitled to enforce the arbitration agreement which would disclose unequivocal intention of the party to give up the benefit of the arbitration agreement and accept the method in preference to the one set out in the arbitration agreement to the one adopted by the other party by filing the suit and get the dispute adjudicated upon by the machinery of the court if this is the underlying intendment in providing that application for stay of the proceedings must be filed before the filing of the written statement the same conclusion must follow when instead of filing the written statement the party has taken some other step in the proceedings\n",
      "that some other step must indisputably be such step as would manifestly display an unequivocal intention to proceed with the suit and to give up the right to have the matter disposed of by arbitration each and every step taken in the proceedings cannot come in the way of the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement by obtaining stay of proceedings but the step taken by the party must be such step as would clearly and unmistakebly indicate an intention on the part of such party to give up the benefit of arbitration agreement and to acquiesce in the proceedings commenced against the party and to get the dispute resolved by the court a step taken in the suit which would disentitle the party from obtaining stay of proceeding must be such step as would display an unequivocal intention to proceed with the suit and to abandon the benefit of the arbitration agreement or the right to get the dispute resolved by arbitration\n",
      "13 if the step in the proceedings contemplated by s 34 must be such step as would clearly unambiguously and unequivocally disclose the intention of the party taking the step to give up the benefit of the arbitration agreement or its right of getting the dispute resolved by arbitration and to acquiesce in the methodology of resolution of dispute by court would an appearence in the suit for contesting interlocutory applications such as application for appointment of receiver or ex parte ad interim injunction mandatory or prohibitory and contesting the same be a step which would disclose an unequivocal intention to proceed with the suit and to give up the benefit of the arbitration agreement  that is the controversy in the appeal before us\n",
      "arbitration agreement generally provides for resolution of disputes either present or future by a forum of the choice of the parties ordinarily arbitration agreement finds its place in contracts apprehending that while preforming contract some disputes may arise care is taken to incorporate an arbitration agreement in the contract itself prescribing the forum for resolution of such disputes to illustrate partnership contracts incorporate arbitration agreement for resolution of disputes arising out of the contract of partnership building contracts these days incorporate arbitration agreements international commercial transactions also incorporate arbitration agreements the purpose underlying entering into arbitration agreement is to provide for resolution of disputes arising from the contract between the parties now if a party to an arbitration agreement files a suit seeking relief in respect of disputes arising from the contract the other party to the agreement can either waive the benefit of the arbitration agreement and acquiesce in the suit or enforce the arbitration agreement\n",
      "14 such conduct has specifically to be in relation to disputes covered by arbitration agreement but if a party to an arbitration agreement files a suit and simultaneously moves an interlocutory application such as an application for appointment of receiver usually to be found in suits for dissolution of partnership and rendering accounts or for an interim injunction to ward off a threatened or continuing breach of contract irreparable harm would be suffered by the other party to the arbitration agreement if it cannot contest the interlocutory application on the pain of abandoning the benefit of arbitration agreement a concrete illustration would be both illuminating and convincing in a suit for dissolution of partnership and accounts an application for appointment of receiver as also an application for interim injunction restraining the defendant from using the partnership goods or assets for continuing the business are filed the court passes ex parte interim order and issues notice calling upon the defendant to show cause why the same should not be made absolute in a running business appointment of a receiver would thoroughly dislocate the business and an injunction would bring to standstill the flourishing business if the defendant appears and contests the application for appointment of receiver as also the application for injunction could he be said to display an unequivocal intention to give up the benefit of the arbitration agreement and to acquiesce in the suit  the dispute between the parties is whether the partnership should be dissolved as per the contract of partnership interim injunction application or application for appointment of receiver have nothing to do directly or substantially with the terms of the partnership the main or substantial dispute will be covered by the plaint filed in the suit incidental proceedings for appointment of receiver or for interim injunction are for the protection either of the property or the interests of the parties now when ex parte orders are obtained on ex parte averments the other party cannot be precluded from coming and pointing out that no case is made out for granting interim relief\n",
      "15 it would be too cumbersome to expect the party first to apply for stay and then invite the court under s 41 2 of the act to vacate the injunction or to discharge the receiver giving the expression taking any other steps in the proceedings such wide connotation as making an application for any purpose in the suit such as vacating stay discharge of the receiver or even modifying the interim orders would work hardship and would be inequitous to the party who is willing to abide by the arbitration agreement and yet be forced to suffer the inequity of ex parte orders therefore the expression taking any other steps in the proceedings must be given a narrow meaning in that the step must be taken in the main proceeding of the suit and it must be such step as would clearly and unambiguously manifest the intention to waive the benefit of the arbitration agreement and to acquiesce in the proceedings interlocutory proceedings are incidental to the main proceedings they have a life till the disposal of the main proceeding as the suit or the proceeding is likely to take some time before the dispute in the suit is finally adjudicated more often interim orders have to be made for the protection of the rights of the parties such interlocutory proceedings stand independent and aloof of the main dispute between the parties involved in the suit they are steps taken for facilitating the just and fair disposal of the main dispute when these interlocutory proceedings are contested it cannot be said that the party contesting such proceedings has displayed an unequivocal intention to waive the benefit of the arbitration agreement or that it has submitted to the jurisdiction of the court when ex parte orders are made at the back of the party the other party is forced to come to the court to vindicate its right such compulsion cannot disclose an unambiguous intention to give up the benefit of the arbitration agreement therefore taking any other steps in the proceedings must be confined to taking steps in the proceedings for resolution of the substantial dispute in the suit appearing and contesting the interlocutory applications by seeking either vacation thereof or modification thereof cannot be said to be displaying an unambiguous intention to acquiesce in the suit and to waive the benefit of the arbitration agreement any other view would both be harsh and inequitous and contrary to the underlying intendment of the act the first party which approaches the court and seeks an ex parte interim order has obviously come to the court in breach of the arbitration agreement by obtaining an ex parte order if it forces the other party to the agreement to suffer the order or by merely contesting be imputed the intention of waiving the benefit of arbitration agreement it would enjoy an undeserved advantages such could not be the underlying purpose of s 34 therefore in our opinion to effectuate the purpose underlying s 34 the narrow construction of the expression taking any other steps in the proceedings as hereinabove set out appears to advance the object and purpose underlying s 34 and the purpose for which the act was enacted\n",
      "16 having examined the contention on the language of the statute the setting in which it is placed the underlying intendment and the purpose it seeks to serve let us turn to precedents there is a clear cut cleavage and divergence of opinion amongst various high courts allahabad bombay and later decisions of calcutta high court gujarat madhya pradesh and rajasthan high courts have taken the view that appearing and contesting interlocutory application is not a step taken in the proceedings so as to disentitle the party from taking benefit of the arbitration agreement by seeking stay of the suit on the other hand earlier decisions of calcutta high court delhi and madras high courts have taken a contrary view\n",
      "in bombay there has been a reference to a practice commended to us by mr sorabji learned counsel for the respondent that to avoid the pitfall of s 34 even while contesting an interlocutory application the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must enter appearance under protest this practice not only does not commend to us but way back in nuruddin abdulhussein v abu ahmed abdul jalliair 1950 bom 1271 1949 indlaw mum 37 tendolkar j has rejected it as one of the doubtful legal import and utility\n",
      "17 one must construe the section on its own language keeping in view the purpose and object of the enactment one cannot add to the requirement by introducing a practice brought into vogue by solicitors in bombay when no such practice exists elsewhere in the country s 34 is even invoked in rural backward areas the highly skilful solicitors draftmanship cannot provide as escape route to an unwary litigent we are therefore not disposed to accept the suggestion that in order to avoid any pitfall of being denied the benefit of arbitration agreement the party seeking to enforce the agreement must enter an appearance under protest because we affirm what tendolkar j has said it reads as under\n",
      "it appears to me therefore that the addition of the words under protest to an appearance filed in court in cases not covered by o 30 rs civil pc is meaningless when neither the jurisdiction of the court nor the validity of the writ or service is challenged it is not challenged where a defendant files an appearance under protest under the prevailing practice because he desires to apply for stay under the arbitration act therefore whatever may be the reason for the practice which has grown up it seems to me clear that there is no obligation on the defendant to follow this practice of doubtful import and utility and he is at liberty to file an unconditional appearance\n",

      "25 in kunta malla reddy v soma srinivas reddy  ors 1977 indlaw ap 144 it was held that the expression steps in the proceedings in s 34 also comprehends step in interlocutory proceedings also in reaching this conclusion reliance was placed on the decis ions of the madras high court a review of these precedents would unmistakably indicate that the trend of the authorities points in the direction of not treating every application made in the suit as a step in the proceeding nor entering appearance with a view to contesting the petition for interim relief such as injunction or appointment of receiver as being steps in the proceedings therefore with respect the decisions taking the contrary view do not commend to us it is at this stage that we must refer to the decision in janki sarcns case in some detail in that case janki saran kailashchandra filed a suit against state of up and divisional forest officer bijnor for recovery of damages alleging breach of contract the summons in the suit issued to the state of up was served on the district government counsel on 2 september 1966 the district government counsel filed an appearance slip in the court and also put in a formal application praying for one months time for the purpose of filing written statement on 1 october 1966 the district government counsel filed an application under s 34 of the act pleading that there was an arbitration clause in the contract between parties to the suit and the state of up being willing to refer the matter to arbitration the suit should be stayed the trial court granted the motion for stay of suit on appeal the high court held that the action of the district government counsel in applying for time to file the written statement amounted to taking a step in the proceedings within the meaning of s 34 of the act and set aside the order of the trial court and rejected the request for stay of proceedings state of up approached this court against the order of the high court rejecting the appeal this court observed as under\n",
      "26 to enable a defendant to obtain an order staying the suit apart from other conditions mentioned in s 34 of the arbitration act he is required to present his application praying for stay before filing his written statement or taking any other step in the suit proceedings in the present case the written statement was indisputably not filed before the application for stay was presented the question is whether any other step was taken in the proceeding as contemplated by s 34 and it is this point with which we are directly concerned in the present case taking other steps in the suit proceedings connotes the idea of doing something in aid of the progress of the suit or submitting to the jurisdiction of the court for the purpose of adjudication of the merits of the controversy in the suit\n",
      "the view herein taken not only does not run counter to the view we have taken but in fact clearly supports the view because the pertinent observation is that taking step in the proceeding which would disentitle a party to obtain a stay of the suit must be doing something in aid of the progress of the suit or submitting to the jurisdiction of the court for the purpose of adjudication of the merits of the controversy in the suit in other words the step must aecessarily manifest the intention of the party to abandon or waive its right to go to arbitration or acquiesce in the dispute being decided by court in fact the view taken in this case should have quelled the controversy but it continued to figure in one form or the other and that is why we have dealt with the matter in detail\n",
      "27 in this context it is advantageous to refer to the provision contained in s 4 of arbitration act 1950 of the united kingdom it provides that in order to be eligible to obtain stay of proceedings the defendant must have taken no steps in the proceedings after appearance analysing what constitutes step in the proceedings inter alia it has been held that the filing of affidavits in answer to an application by the plaintiff for appointment of receiver does not amount to taking a step in the proceeding check zalinoff v hammond referred to in halsburys laws of england 4th end vol 2 para 563 note 12 russell on arbitration 19th edn page 183 under the heading steps held not to be in the proceedings notes that filing affidavits in reply to plaintiffs affidavits in support of a motion for a receiver in a partnership action is not a step in the proceedings there are 56 other situations noticed by the author which when individually analysed would show that the steps taken with reference to interlocutory proceedings are ordinarily not held as steps in the proceedings\n",
      "having thus critically examined both on principle and precedent the meaning to be given to the expression taking steps in the proceedings we are clearly of the view that unless the step alleged to have been taken by the party seeking to enforce arbitration agreement is such as would display an unequivocal intention to proceed with the suit and acquiesce in the method of resolution of dispute adopted by the other party namely filing of the suit and thereby indicate that it has abandoned its right under the arbitration agreement to get the dispute resolved by arbitration any other step would not disentitle the party from seeking relief under s 34 it may be clearly emphasised that contesting the application for interim injunction or for appointment of a receiver or for interim relief by itself without anything more would not constitute such step as would disentitle the party to an order under s 34 of the act\n",
      "28 reverting to the facts of this case it is crystal clear that the defendants had taken no steps in the proceedings which would disentitle them to a relief under s 34 suit was filed on 1 june 1981 impleading two defendants food corporation of india 1st defendant and shyam narain nigam 2nd defendant being the district manager of the 1st defendant corporation alongwith the plaint a notice of motion was taken out for ex parte ad interim injunction the court issued notice on the notice of motion and made it returnable on the next day ie 2 june 1981 when the matter was placed on board of the court on 2 june 1981 the proceedings show that the district manager 2nd defendant was served and appeared through advocate shri nk modi defendant 1 was shown absent with an endorsement the summons showing service not received back then comes what transpired on that day as disclosed in the proceedings of the day the same may be extracted\n",

      "30 the learned judge also negatived the prayed for stay for the additional reason that the 1st defendant had not complied with another condition for relief under s 34 the learned judge found that in the application for stay the applicant had not stated that at the time when the proceedings were commenced it was ready and willing to do all things necessary to the proper conduct of the arbitration and still remains ready and willing to do the same the learned judge held after referring to the averments in the application for stay that there is no averment to that effect plaintiff contesting the application had not raised this contention before the trial court and the first appellate court and that becomes evident from what the learned judge has stated in the judgment that both the courts have not taken into account this aspect of the case at all obviously the learned judge ought not to have permitted the contention while hearing a revision petition under s 115 of the code of civil procedure but apart from this the finding of the learned judge is contrary to record the application for stay was read over to us and a copy was submitted for our perusal in para 2 of the application it is clearly stated that the defendant is ready and willing ichhuk for this purpose it appears that the original application was in hindi the important word used in the application is ichhuk which it was agreed would mean ready and willing it is followed by the expression for this purpose which would imply that the ist defendant was always ready and willing to proceed with the arbitration when commenced and is shown to be ready and willing at the time of applying for stay therefore the ist defendant had complied with the requirement of his readiness and willingness to go to arbitration therefore the learned judge was clearly in error in interfering with the order of the trial court confirmed by the ist appellate court on this ground also\n",
      "accordingly we hold that the learned judge of the high court was clearly in error in interfering with the order made by the trial court and confirmed in appeal granting stay of the suit the judgment of the high court is accordingly set aside and the one made by the trial court and confirmed in appeal is restored with no order as to costs\n",

      "9  the high court further observed that after the post is sanctioned the university shall advertise and fill up the vacancy by appointing petitioner no 4 if he is otherwise qualified the review petition was disposed of accordingly it may be stated that the high court did not accept the contention of the university that the writ petitioners are not employees of the university to whom the benefit of go ms no 212 could be extended against the order of the learned single judge in the review petition the university filed writ appeal which was dismissed by the division bench on 341997 affirming the order of the learned single judge the division bench observed that all employments in the institute whether grant for the post comes from the state government or from the central government are employments in the institute which is an agency of the government of the state of andhra pradesh and thus all government orders intended to apply to such agency of the government of the state have to be applied to it\n",
      "10  on appeal by the university this court stayed the operation of the judgment of the high court we are of the view that the high court fell into error in applying go no 212 dated 2241994 to the case of the writ petitioners the observations of the division bench that the nodal centre is an agency of the state government is obviously without factual and legal basis the terms and features of the scheme unmistakably indicates that the university a centre of excellence chosen by the ministry of education acts for and on behalf of government of india and the nodal centre is nothing but the reflection of central government acting through the media of university the entire funding is done by the central government and the nodal centre functions under the overall supervision and guidance of the lead centre attached to the ministry of education even the details of expenditure including the payments to be made to the staff of various categories are spelt out in the scheme as well as in the orders releasing the annual grants there is therefore an obvious fallacy in the reasoning of the high court that the institute nodal centre acts as an agency of the state government the state government does not come into the picture at all\n",
      "11  in our view it would be wholly inappropriate to apply go no 212 to the temporary staff appointed by the university exclusively for the nodal centre set up under the auspices of the government of india go ms no 212 is not intended to cover the employees such as the writ petitioners who are engaged in the nodal centre which for all practical purposes acts as a wing of the central government in one sense the writ petitioners may be regarded as employees of the university as they were appointed by the university and the disciplinary control vests with the university in another sense they are protgs of the central government go 212 has to be understood and applied having due regard to its tenor and purpose the go no doubt envisages regularization of the services of the persons appointed on daily wages or consolidated pay that fulfil the conditions lay down therein\n",
      "12  but it is intended to cover the categories of employees working in the state government departmentsinstitutions or bodies controlled or administered by the state government and in respect of whom the state government or such bodies have to bear the financial burden on account of regularization the last para of go no 212 gives the clear indication of its purport and intendment the said para reads as under\n",
      "all the departments of secretariatheads of departments are requested to process the cases of absorption regularization of services of nmrsdaily wage employees etc in pursuance of the above scheme and obtain the clearance of govt in finance  planning pw pc iii department before orders are issued for such regularization or absorption\n",
      "13  can it be said that by virtue of this provision the state government assumes the responsibility of absorbing the staff employed in the organizations or establishments with which it has no administrative or financial nexus merely because an instrumentality of the state is involved in managing it that too in a limited sense the answer could only be in the negative when the state government or its instrumentalities have not created the posts on their own and do not bear any part of financial burden the question of getting the clearance from the finance and planning department of the government for the purpose of regularization or absorption does not arise viewed from any angle go 212 would be wholly out of place for those working in the nodal centre which is created and nurtured by the central government it is not within the domain of the state government or even university to regulate the staff pattern or the monetary benefits of the staff working therein without the approval of central government therefore no directions should have been issued to the state government or to the university to regularize the services of respondents 1 to 5 if necessary by creating additional posts\n",
      "14  the next question is whether the central government ie respondents 7  8 should be directed to take steps to create posts with appropriate payscales in the nodal centre for the purpose of absorbing respondents 1 to 5 on regular basis by reason of their longstanding service it is pointed out by the learned counsel for the respondentemployees that the nodal centre though conceived as a temporary scheme has come to stay for nearly two decades by now and its relevance is not lost in the present day context and the possibility of its disbandment is remote the learned counsel therefore contends that there is every justification for absorbing the concerned respondents on regular basis in recognition of their long satisfactory service\n",
      "15  the learned counsel further contends that the adhoc arrangement to employ them on consolidated pay should not go on forever the contention of the learned counsel cannot be sustained for more than one reason and we find no valid grounds to grant the relief of regularization there is nothing on record to show that the concerned employees were appointed after following due procedure for selection apparently they were picked and chosen by the university authorities to cater to the exigencies of work in the nodal centre secondly having regard to the background in which respondents 1 to 4 were drafted to perform the job assigned to them it is difficult to concede to them the status of regular government servants\n",
      "16  as seen earlier the scheme envisaged the employment of senior engineering students during vacation periods and for payment of remuneration for the work done by them as the students were not prepared to take up the work of investigation as stated in the counter affidavit filed in the high court the university authorities thought of inducting respondents 1 to 4 to perform the job which was expected to be done by the postgraduate students on parttime basis the appointment of respondents 1 to 4 was thought of only by way of substituting them for the engineering students who in the normal course would have taken up the work pursuant to the scheme the plea to regularize their services is misconceived having regard to the background and circumstances in which respondents 1 to 4 came to be appointed as regards the 5th respondent the position is still worse no post of attender has been sanctioned under the scheme however as seen from the counteraffidavit filed in the high court her salary was being met out of the funds allocated for office expenditure\n",
      "17  though the plea of regularization in respect of any of the five respondents cannot be countenanced the respondentemployees should have a fair deal consistent with the guarantee enshrined in arts 21 and 14 of the constitution they should not be made to work on meagre salary for years together it would be unfair and unreasonable to extract work from the employees who have been associated with the nodal centre almost from its inception by paying them remuneration which by any objective standards is grossly low the central government itself has rightly realized the need to revise the consolidated salary and accordingly enhanced the grant on that account on two occasions\n",
      "18  that revision was made more than six years back it is high time that another revision is made it is therefore imperative that the concerned ministry of the union of india should take expeditious steps to increase the salary of investigators viz respondents 1 to 4 working in the nodal centre in hyderabad in the absence of details regarding the nature of work done by the said respondents and the equivalence of the job done by them to the other posts prevailing in the university or the central government institutions we are not in a position to give any direction based on the principle of equal pay for equal work\n",
      "19 however we consider it just and expedient to direct respondent no7 or 8 as the case may be to take an expeditious decision to increase the consolidated salary that is being paid to respondents 1 to 4 to a reasonable level commensurate with the work done by them and keeping in view the minimum salary that is being paid to the personnel doing more or less similar job as far as the 5th respondent is concerned though we refrain from giving similar directions in view of the fact that the post is not specifically sanctioned under the scheme we would like to observe that the central government may consider increasing the quantum of office expenditure suitably so that the university will be able to disburse higher salary to the 5th respondent\n",
      "20  in the result we set aside the judgment of the high court and allow the appeal subject however to the directions given and observations made in this judgment no costs\n",

      "the order of the court was as follows \n",
      "writ petition civil no 66 of 1995\n",
      "1  we have heard the petitioner and also the counsel for the respondents\n",
      "2  numerous orders had been passed earlier in this writ petition dealing with various aspects of the case on 16th march 1998 this court required the petitioner to give in writing the issues which survived in the writ petition in respect of which directions from this court were necessary\n",
      "3  pursuant to the said directions the petitioner filed an affidavit dated 16th april 1998 two categories under which issues were stated to arise were  firstly alleged arbitrary functioning of the bhopal gas relief tribunal and secondly with regard to the medical facilities\n",
      "4  in relation to the allegation regarding the arbitrary functioning of the tribunal the grievance was that there was defective medical categorisation preparation of illegal compensation and categorisation list holding of socalled lok adalats which was illegal arbitrary manner in which the suo motu revisional powers were exercised etc\n",
      "5  after the bhopal gas tragedy a scheme had been prepared in 1985 by the government of india para 5 of the said scheme provided for categorisation and registration of claims subclause 2 dealt with different categories under which the claims could be registered pursuant thereto the central government under subclause 2 of para 11 of the scheme determined the total amount of compensation which could be apportioned for each category ofclaims and the quantum of compensation payable in general in relation to each type of injury or loss\n",
      "6  one of the grievances which has been made before us is that the deputy commissioners adopted and formulated their own yardsticks for the purpose of paying compensation to the claimants for example for chronic conjunctivitis proposed amount of compensation was rs 35000 it is submitted by the petitioner that mentioning these amounts as compensation payable was arbitrary and contrary to the scheme\n",
      "7  there is no grievance with regard to the quantum of compensation which has been specified by the government under for each category the amount of compensation payable is specified in two cases the amount specified is fixed whereas in the case of other categories there is a scale which had been provided within which the amount of compensation is required to be determined on 6th december 1997 in the proposed compensation amount it was clarified that the figures mentioned therein were only guidelines and were not conclusive as to tie amount of compensation which was payable and if the deputy commissioner or the additional commissioner was satisfied then for reasons to be recorded in writting they could award compensation in excess of the amount indicated therein\n",
      "8  as we see it the limits within which compensation can be awarded for claimants falling under different categories the central government has specified the amounts specific ailments are not mentioned therein in practice the deputy welfare commissioner and the additional welfare commissioner have to deal with ailments and the question would arise as to under what category of para 5 of the scheme would they fall and secondly as to what is the specific amount which is payable to them within the scale the committee of deputy commissioners appear to have formulated a yardstick which would obviously avoid delay in the determination of the amount of compensation which is payable in a modification carried out on 6th december 1997 it has been made clear and in our opinion rightly so that the amount determined as compensation for different types of ailments is not final it will be subject to determination afresh if called in question either in appeal or in revision before the welfare commissioner we would at this stage like to emphasise that we have seen orders pased by the welfare commissioner where he has entertained revision petitions against the orders in appeal passed by the additional commissioner a welfare commissiner is a sitting judge of the madhya pradesh high court and normally therefore the claimant should have no cause of grievance after the decision by the welfare commissioner even if thereafter there is some grievance the right of judicial review inter alia provided by articles 226 and 227 of the constitution is always available there can be little doubt that the aggrieved persons are entitled to receive fair and just compensation andor damages due to them there is now a system in place and any claims which are made have to be determined within this system there is first determination by the deputy welfare commissioner against which an appeal can be filed to the additional welfare commissioner and thereafter a revision to the welfare commissioner if even then there is a grievance of a claimant proper remedy is to approach the high court who would be in a position to deal with a case more expeditiously and give relief to the individual claimant where it is called for without undue expense rather than approaching this court under article 32 or article 136 of the constitution\n",
      "9  as far as the grievance of the petitioner that the lok adalats which were constituted were sham and all those decisions should be set at naught we are not inclined to accept the said contention it appears that grievance with regard to lok adalats was made before this court whereupon order dated 7th november 1997 was passed in which it was inter alia observed as follows \n",
      " in the circumstances it is directed that the claimant falling in medical category c and above who feels aggrieved by the amount of compensation awarded by the lok adalats and the appeal being not entertained by the additional welfare commissioner against such award may file a review petition for review of the award such review petition shall be considered by the concerned additional welfare commissioner the office of the welfare commissioner shall issue a public notice with regard to above direction given by this court and publish it in a local newspaper so that the claimants may know that they can file a review petition the review petition should be filed within two months from the date of the publication of the notice\n",
      "10  this order inter alia postulated the entertaining of review petitions in cases of claimants failing under medical category c and above and whose appeals had not been entertained by the additional welfare commissioner and the review petitions could be filed within two months of the public notice being issued in the local newspapers we are informed that such public notice was issued this direction to our mind would clearly safeguard the interest of those persons who really felt aggrieved by the decision of the lok adalats and had then sought to challenge the sameif there was no challenge to the agreement arrived at in the lok adalats the order dated 7th november 1997 did not postulate giving a further opportunity the said decision of 7th november 1997 of this court does not require any reconsideration even though the petitioner submitted that this should be done\n",
      "11  the grievance is also made with regard to lack of proper medical research and the nonfunctioning of the hospitals and generally with regard to the medical facilities the issues raised in this regard are converted by writ petition civil no 50 of 1998 bhopal gas peedith manila u sangat  ors v uoi  ors 1999 indlaw sc 1050 in our opinion it will be more appropriate to deal with these aspects of the case namely pertaining to the furnishing of the medical facilities in writ petition c no 50 of 1998 in that petition pleadings are complete affidavits have bees filed and some orders passed the petitioner will be at liberty to assist the learned counsel appearing in writ petition civil no 50 of 1998 if necessary even though we are disposing of this writ petition the counsel appearing in writ petition civil no 50 of 1998 will be at liberty to refer to any affidavit or document which may have been filed in this writ petition\n",
      "12  this writ petition is disposed of in the aforesaid manner it is clarified that if any of the claimants has any grievance against an order passed by the welfare commissioner or by the tribunal it is open to the claimant to seek judicial review but first it must be sought before the high court rather than filing a writ petition under article 32 or a special leave petition under article 136 directly in this court contempt petition c no 3641998 in wp c no 661995\n",
      "13  the petitioner is permitted to withdraw this petition with liberty to file a fresh petition giving all necessary particulars this contempt petition is accordingly dismissed as withdrawn\n",

      "wp cr no 307 of 1993 under article 32 of the constitution of india\n",
      "the judgment was delivered by ahmadi j\n",
      "1 the narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances act 1985 61 of 1985 hereinafter alluded to as the act was enacted inter alia to make stringent provisions for the control and regulation of operations relating to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and for matters connected therewith the enactment received the presidents assent on 1691985 the dictionary of the act is to be found in s 2 thereof s 2xxix says that words and expressions used in the act and not defined but defined in the code of criminal procedure 1973 hereinafter called the code shall have the meanings assigned to them in the code the act is divided into six chapters comprising 83 sections\n",
      "since in the instant case we are concerned with only a few provisions we need not examine the scheme of the act we had an occasion to examine the scheme of the act in some detail in raj kumar karwal v union of india  1990 indlaw sc 990  1990 indlaw sc 990 chapter iv defines the offences and prescribes stringent punishments with minimum punishments and fines for them for certain offences the punishment prescribed can extend to rigorous imprisonment for 20 years and a fine of rupees two lakhs with a minimum rigorous imprisonment of 10 years and a fine of rupees one lakh\n",
      "2 by s 37 offences punishable under the act are made cognizable and nonbailable where the offender is accused of an offence punishable with imprisonment of 5 years or more the section provides that he shall not be released on bail or on his own bond unless i the public prosecutor has had an opportunity to oppose the bail and ii if bail is opposed the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty and is not likely to indulge in the commission of similar offences\n",
      "3 by amending act no 2 of 1989 styled as the narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances amendment act 1988 farreaching changes came to be made in the act this amending act came into force with effect from 2951989 vide s o 379e of even date by this amending act the punishment prescribed under the newly added section 31a for certain offences extended to death penalty also s 36 came to be replaced by a new provision and sections 36a to 36d were inserted for the first time the substituted section 36 insofar as relevant for our purpose reads thus\n",
      "36 constitution of special courts  1 the government may for the purpose of providing speedy trial of the offences under this act by notification in the official gazette constitute as many special courts as may be necessary for such areas as may be specified in the notification\n",
      "2 a special court shall consist of a single judge who shall be appointed by the government with the concurrence of the chief justice of the high court\n",
      "4 only a sessions judge or an additional sessions judge is eligible to be appointed a special judge under section 36a all offences under the act shall be triable only by the special court constituted for the area in which the commission of the offence has taken place this provision overrides the provisions in the code section 36b clarifies that appeals and revisions from the orders passed by the special courts shall lie to the high court as if they were passed by a sessions court\n",
      "section 36c provides for the application of the provisions of the code to proceedings before the special court as if the special court is a court of session unless the act provides otherwise we then come to section 36d which may be reproduced at this stage it reads\n",
      "36d transitional provisions  1 any offence committed under this act on or after the commencement of the narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances amendment act 1988 until a special court is constituted under section 36 shall notwithstanding anything contained in the code of criminal procedure 1973 2 of 1974 be tried by a court of session\n",
      "provided that offences punishable under sections 26 27 and 32 may be tried summarily\n",
      "2 nothing in subs 1 shall be construed to require the transfer to a special court of any proceedings in relation to an offence taken cognizance of by a court of session under the said subs 1 and the same shall be heard and disposed of by the court of session\n",
      "5 it becomes immediately clear that before the introduction of the present group of provisions by amending act no 2 of 1989 the offences under the act were triable by the ordinary courts under the code however after the enactment of the act it was expected that speedy trials and harsh punishments would help prevent and combat abuse of and illicit traffic in narcotic drugs etc and rid the society of drug menace but it was soon realised that the aim of bringing the culprits to book with dispatch was not achieved\n",
      "the legislature therefore though that the aim of speedy trials may be achieved if special courts are constituted to try offences under the act this objective is clearly writ large in the text of s 36 which in no uncertain terms says that the government may constitute special courts for the purpose of providing speedy trial of offences under this act that is why section 36a posits that all offences under the act shall be triable only by the special court constituted for the area under section 36 notwithstanding anything in the code cl d of subs 1 of section 36a empowers the special court to take cognizance of an offence under the act upon a police report or upon a complaint made by an authorised officer\n",
      "6 section 36c extends the provisions of the code to proceedings before the special court save as otherwise provided in the act so that where the act does not make any specific provision to the contrary the special court may not be hamstrung and may lean on the provisions in the code but then till the establishment of the special courts provisions had to be made to cover the transitional period to avoid a stalemate situation and hence and need for section 36d the importance of this provision is realised when we take notice of the fact that in many state the constitution of special courts was delayed by a couple of years or even more\n",
      "7 the provision made in section 36d assumes considerable importance in deciding the principle question which arises in this case but before we indicate the backdrop in which the question falls for decision it may be advantageous to understand the true scope and import of this transitional provision the section applies to cases where the offence referred to under the act been committed on or after the commencement of the amendment act ie 2951989 it has no application to offence committed before 2951989 offence committed under the act on and after 2951989 would have to be tried by the special court constituted for the area in view of cl a of subs 1 of section 36a but the legislature was aware that there may be a timegap between the coming into force of the provisions contained in ss 36 and 36a and the constitution of the special court for the area concerned\n",
      "it has therefore provided that offence committed under the act on or after 2951989 shall be tried by a court of session until a special court for the area is constituted under section 36 notwithstanding anything contained in the code\n",
      "8 therefore offences committed before 2951989 would be continued to be tried by courts constituted under the code subs 2 of section 36d clarifies that nothing in subs 1 shall be construed to require the transfer of any proceedings to a special court if the court of session has taken cognizance of the offence under subs 1 once the court of session has taken cognizance of an offence committed on or after 2951989 at a time when the special court was not in existence such a case will not be required to be transferred to the special court subsequently constituted and the same would have to be heard and disposed of by the court of session\n",
      "thus proceedings which have commenced before the court of session in respect whereof it has taken cognizance before the establishment of the special court shall be heard and disposed of by the former which implies that cases pending before the court of session in relation whereto it has not taken cognizance would have to be transferred to the special court on its constitution\n",
      "9 s 36 of the act lays down the mode for the constitution of a special court it provides that government may by notification in the official gazette constitute as many special courts as may be necessary for the areas to be specified in the notification therefore as soon as the notification contemplated by s 36 is published in the official gazette constituting one or more special courts for the areas to be specified in the notification the special court comes into existence subs 2 says that the special court shall consist of single judge appointed by the government in the manner provided by that subsection subsection 2 therefore indicates the strength of the special court that is to say it will consist of a single judge\n",
      "10 we may now give an abridged version of the factual matrix a large number of cases in relation to offences under the at were detected in bombay and prosecutions were launched against the offenders until 2851989 these cases were being dealt with by courts having jurisdiction under the code judicial magistrates where they had jurisdiction depending on the maximum sentence provided for the offence concerned dealt with such cases but where the sentence prescribed conferred jurisdiction on the court of session orders of committal of such cases came to be passed as the number of such cases was large there was accumulation of work in the court of session of bombay the sessions judge bombay distributed such cases amongst his colleagues who were additional sessions judges\n",
      "however the distribution was so made that there was accumulation of such work in the court of single additional sessions judge shri pathan after the insertion of sections 36 36a and 36d by the amending act no 2 of 1989 the state government published on 411991 a notification constituting two special courts for greater bombay by a subsequent notification dated 641991 published in the official gazette shri pathan was appointed a judge of one of the special courts constituted by the notification of 411991\n",
      "on the retirement of shri pathan shri ghare succeeded him with effect from 2521992 when certain bail applications were taken up by shri ghare a contention was raised that in cases in which the court of session had taken cognizance before the constitution of the special court the latter had not jurisdiction a contention which found favour with the learned judge this gave rise to the question whether the learned judge was right in the view taken by him the issue came up before the bombay high court in certain criminal applications preferred by the department as well as the accused persons daud j who heard these applications put the issue a little broadly in that he covered offences committed not only prior to 411991 the date on which the notification constituting special courts was issued and published in the official gazette but also offence up to 541991 the date on which the notification appointing shri pathan was issued and published in the official gazette\n",
      "11 this has given rise to the question  when is a court constituted  daud j after pointing out the divergence of views between different high courts approved the view expressed by hansaria cj as he then was in bhagwan singh v state of orissa  1992 2 ccr 1237  departing from the view expressed by deshpande j of the same high court in suryakant ramdas more v state of maharashtra  1989 indlaw mum 242  1898 2 bom cr 653 bom hc we may incidentally mention that the view expressed by hansaria cj on the need for a committal order by a magistrate before the sessions judge can take cognizance was not approved by the full bench of the orissa high court in banka das v state of orissa  1993 75 clt 225 ori daud j also took the view that the special court could be said to have been legally constituted on 641991\n",
      "he therefore concluded that in respect of offence committed between 2951989 and 641991 during which period the special courts were not in existence the court of session only could exercise jurisdiction in view of the clear language of section 36d this is how the learned judge sums up\n",
      "in respect of cases relating to offences committed prior to 2851989 trial of these cases was to be governed under the code of criminal procedure 1973 in respect of such cases if the magistrates were empowered to award the sentences prescribed by the different sections they could deal with the matters where the offences were punishable with imprisonment for 10 years and more the magistrates had to commit the offenders to stand trial in the court of session the second category was that of persons who had committed offence under the act between 2951989 and 541991 such offences were to be tried by a court of session under subs 1 of section 36d of the ndps act judge ghare seems to have made a distinction between offences committed in the period 411991 to 541991 this seems to rest on his making a distinction between the creation of a court and the appointment of a judge to man it the distinction is without any significance for the constitution would be incomplete unless a judge is appointed to man the created special court\n",
      "12 the third category would be offences committed after 541991 here the jurisdiction would unquestionably be that of the special court judge ghare has to be sustained when he says that he does not have jurisdiction to entertain cases relating to offences committed prior to 411991 as a matter of fact the disability extends right up to 541991\n",
      "13 before daud j rendered his decision on 181992 the learned additional sessions judge shri ghare had made a reference to the high court us 3951 of the code relating to certain foreign nationals who were languishing in jails for long periods for the commission of offence under the act this reference was heard and answered by a division bench of the high court on 1891992 while answering the reference the division bench comprising kurudukar and saldhana jj dealt with the question regarding the true meaning and scope of section 36d2 of the act in doing so it noticed the decision rendered by daud j only a few days before after referring to the relevant provisions of the act and the caselaw bearing on the point kurudukar j as he then was who spoke for the bench observed\n",
      "us 361 the government may constitute a special courtcourts and such constituted courtcourts shall be manned by judges in terms of s 363 of the act\n",
      "there could be a situation like a present one where the government has issued notification constituting special courtcourts under the act but the notification appointing judges to man such courtcourts was not issued simultaneously but issued after some time then in such a situation courtcourts constituted under ordinary criminal law of the land code will have jurisdiction to try offences committed under the act this period ie until judges are appointed would be a transitional period covered by section 36d1 of the act section 36d is a deeming provision and requires to be given its true meaning having regard to the object of act 2 of 1989 court of session will be deemed to be as if a special court unless we read this deeming provision in section 36d1 of the act true meaning thereof cannot be assigned and any other construction of this subsection will render the object in enacting this subsection nugatory\n",
      "14 then in the light of what he called the deeming provision the learned judge proceeded to ascertain the true meaning of section 36d2 and held that\n",
      "if section 36a1 a and 36d1 and 2 are read together it leaves no manner of doubt that section 36d has been enacted to cover such transitional period where the special court is not constituted in the real sense and trial has commenced before the court of session\n",
      "the division bench then adverted to the views of daud j that unless a judge is appointed to the special court the special court cannot be said to have been constituted under the act and consequently cases in which cognizance has been taken by the court of session upto 641991 would fall outside the purview of the special court and proceeded to observe\n",
      "from this unreported decision it appears that the contention as regards deeming provision under section 36d was not raised before the learned single judge consequently the learned single judge had no occasion to consider the effect of the deeming provision contained in section 36d1 of the act with great respect to the learned single judge we are unable to agree with the view taken by him in this unreported decision in the view which we have taken this unreported decision needs to be overruled and we do so\n",
      "15 the division bench in the ultimate concluded that i cases filed under the act prior to 2951989 shall be tried by the court of session ii cases filed on and after 2951989 shall be tried by the special court constituted under the act and iii if cognizance of a case is taken by a sessions court during transitional period in the absence of constitution of special court in the real sense the sessions court shall not be required to transfer the case to be special court if it has substantially proceeded with the trial with respect there are two aspects of the judgment which are difficult to comprehend firstly reference to the deeming provision in section 36d1  there is no such deeming provision therein  and\n",
      "secondly reference to the constitution of the special court in the real sense after overruling daud j that the constitution is complete only after the appointment of a judge to the special court the division bench therefore is largely in agreement with the view expressed by daud j except that cases pending with the court of session from 411991 to 541991 would also triable by that court if it has taken cognizance but here again as pointed out above there is some confusion when the division bench carves out an exception that if during the transitional period there is no constitution of the special court in the real sense and the case has proceeded substantially before the court of session it will not be necessary to transfer it to the special court\n",
      "16 in order to answer the point arising for our determination we may first refer to a few provisions of the code by virtue of s 41 all offences under the indian penal code have to be investigated inquired into tried and otherwise dealt with according to the provisions of the code s 42 provides that all offences under any other law shall be similarly investigated inquired into tried and otherwise dealt with under the code subject of course to any law for the time being in force regulating the manner or place of investigating inquiring into trying or otherwise dealing with such offences s 6 provides that except the high courts and courts constituted under any other law ie other than the code there shall be in every state the following classes of criminal courts namely\n",
      "i courts of session\n",
      "ii judicial magistrates first class or metropolitan magistrates\n",
      "iii judicial magistrates second class and\n",
      "iv executive magistrates\n",
      "17 the powers of different courts have been indicated in chapter iii the high court or court of session can try any offence under the penal code and pass any sentence authorised by law but a sentence of death if passed by the sessions court would be subject to confirmation by the high court a chief judicial magistrate and a chief metropolitan magistrate may pass a sentence for a term not exceeding seven years a judicial magistrate of the first class and metropolitan magistrate are empowered to pass a sentence for a term not exceeding three years s 209 provides that when an accused appears or is brought before a magistrate and it appears that the offence is triable exclusively by the court of session the magistrate shall commit the case to the court of session\n",
      "18 it will thus be seen that where an offence is exclusively triable by the court of session the magistrate is enjoined by law to pass an order committing the case to the court of session for trial once the case is committed the court of session can take cognizance at any time thereafter\n",
      "19 now under the act different punishments have been prescribed for different offences ranging from six months to twenty years and even death to those with previous conviction therefore under the code some of the offences would be triable by a magistrate of the first class or metropolitan magistrate some by the chief judicial magistrate or chief metropolitan magistrate and the rest by the court of session this was the position till the act underwent changes by virtue of the amendments introduced by amending act no 2 of 1989 the introduction of sections 36 36a to 36d changed the situation\n",
      "20 s 36 provides for the constitution of special courts and section 36a1a says that notwithstanding anything contained in the code all offences under the act shall be triable only by special court constituted for the area in which the offence has been committed or where there are more special courts than one for such area by such one of them as may be specified in this behalf by the government on a conjoint reading of these two provisions it becomes clear beyond any manner of doubt that once a special court or more than one has been constituted for an are or areas in which the offence has been committed then notwithstanding anything contained in the code the special court alone will have jurisdiction and all other courts exercising jurisdiction prior to the constitution of the special courts will cease to have jurisdiction\n",
      "subsections 36a1a and d which also begin with a nonobstante clause  notwithstanding anything contained in the code  provided that a special court may upon a perusal of the police report of the facts constituting an offence under the act or upon a complaint made by an officer of the government concerned authorised in this behalf take cognizance of that offence without the accused being committed to it for trial this is a provision which is analogous to s 190 of the code it is clear from this provision that a special court may take cognizance of an offence without the accused being committed to it for trial section 36c makes the provisions of the code applicable to proceedings before a special court save as otherwise provide in the act and says that the special court shall be deemed to be a court of session\n",
      "21 that brings us to section 36d which is a transitional provision under subs 1 of section 36d any offence committed under the act on or after the commencement of the amendment act 1988 until a special court is constituted under section 36 shall notwithstanding anything contained in the code be tried by a court of session the nonobstante clause in this provision makes it clear that until a special court is constituted under section 36 the court of session shall try any offence committed on or after the commencement of the amendment act and no other court including the magistrates court will have jurisdiction to try an offence under the act subs 2 of section 36d further provides that nothing in subs 1 shall be construed to require the transfer to a special court of any proceeding in relation to an offence taken cognizance of by the court of session under subs 1 and the same shall be continued heard and decided by the latter court\n",
      "as we have pointed out earlier before this group of sections came to be introduced in the act by the amending act 2 of 1989 with effect from 2951989 the offences under the act were triable by different courts under the code depending on the punishments provided therefor but after the introduction of this group of sections in the act the legislature with a view to speeding up the trial provided for the constitution of a special court and until such court was constituted it provided by subs 1 of section 36b that the court of session will have jurisdiction to try any offence committed under the act the provisions in the code notwithstanding\n",
      "22 the effect of this provision is to vest jurisdiction in the court of session alone during the transitional period in respect of offences under the act even where the punishment prescribed is three years or less ordinarily the magistrates court would have power to try the offence under the code but by this provision the power is vested in the court of session alone and therefore the courts of the magistrates first class metropolitan magistrates chief judicial magistrates and chief metropolitan magistrates would cease to have jurisdiction subs 1 of section 36a overrides the provisions of the code so from the date of its introduction on the statute book the magisterial courts ceased to have jurisdiction or power to try any offence committed under the act even if the punishment prescribed is three years or less since only the court of session is empowered to deal with such cases\n",
      "there would therefore be no question of the magistrate going through the exercise of committal proceedings as on account of the nonobstante clause in section 36d1 a all offences under the act become triable only by the court of session till the constitution of special courts and thereafter by the special court ordinarily therefore cases pending before the court of session by virtue of section 36d1 would be transferred to the special court but subs 2 of section 36d carves out an exception in relation to an offence of which the court of session has already taken cognizance where the court of session has already taken cognizance under subs 1 of section 36d that court will be entitled to hear and dispose of the case and will not be required to transfer the same to the special court of the area by virtue of the exception carved out by subs 2 of section 36d\n",
      "23 on a conjoint reading of sections 36 36a to 36d it seems clear to us that after the insertion of these provisions all offences under the act have to be tried by the special court for the area constituted us 36 that is the thrust of cl a of subs 1 of section 36a but the legislature was aware that there may be a timegap between the coming into force of these provisions wef 2951989 and the constitution of a special court this period which is a transitional period is taken care of by section 36d of the act under this provision during the transitional period offences committed under the act would be tried by the court of session alone notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the code but once the special court is constituted under s 36 that court alone would have jurisdiction to try the offences under the act save and except those in relation whereto the sessions court has already taken cognizance\n",
      "it is not necessary to elaborate on when cognizance is understood to have been taken because that is fairly wellsettled by a catena of decisions of this court vide decisions based on an interpretation of s 190 of the code also in kishun singh v state of bihar  1993 indlaw sc 197  \n",
      "24 this takes us to the next question  when can a special court be said to have been constituted  the plain language of s 36 says that the government may by notification in the official gazette constitute as many special courts as may be necessary for such areas as may be specified in the notification therefore the mode of constitution of special courts is by issuance of a notification in the official gazette specifying the area for which each special court is constituted subs 2 of s 36 states that the special court will be a single judge court subs 3 next provides that a person who has immediately before such appointment functioned as a sessions judge or an additional sessions judge shall be eligible to be appointed as a judge of the special court\n",
      "section 36 therefore has two stages namely the first stage in regard to the constitution of special courts is by issuance of a notification in the official gazetted and then comes the appointment of the individual to function as a judge of the special court therefore as soon as the notification is issued under subs 1 of s 36 the process of constitution of a special court commences and it is only thereafter that the government can seek the concurrence of the chief justice of the high court for the appointment of a judge of that court as stated earlier only a person who has worked as a sessions judge or additional sessions judge immediately before such appointment is qualified to be a judge of the special court this is the plain language of section 36\n",
      "25 but the question still survives whether the constitution of the special court can be said to be complete and effective only after the judge to preside over the court is appointed  the likelihood of a timegap between the issuance of a notification under subs 1 of s 36 and the appointment of a judge to man the court has to be countenanced this is evident from the facts of this case which show that the notification under s 361 was issued on 411991 and the notification appointing shri pathan to man one of the two courts was issued on 641991 can the special court be said to have been constituted on 411991 or on 641991  daud j opines that it could be said to have been constituted with effect from 641991 the learned counsel for the petitioner commends the view of daud j for acceptance\n",
      "the division bench as pointed out earlier disagreed with daud j on the erroneous view that daud j had omitted to notice the deeming provision in section 36d1 when there is no such deeming provision in that subsection or for that matter in section 36d secondly reference to constitution of the special court in the real sense betrays confusion since daud j has also not discussed this question in detail we may briefly deal with it\n",
      "26 it is common knowledge that a court is an agency created by the sovereign for the purpose of administering justice it is a place where justice is judicially administered it is a legal entity it is a tribunal presided over by one or more judges on whom are conferred certain judicial powers for administering justice in accordance with law when a judge takes his seat in court the court is said to have assembled for administering justice thus the word court is a generic term and embraces a judge but the vice versa is not true therefore the words court and judge are frequently used interchangeably because a judge is an essential constituent of a court since there can be no dispensation of justice without a judge but that is not to say that when a judge demits office the court ceases to exist bacon defines a court as\n",
      "an incorporeal being which requires for its existence the presence of the judge or a competent number of them and a clerk or prothonotary at or during which and at a place where it is by law authorised to be held\n",
      "in corpus juris secundum vol 21 we find the following statement\n",
      "a court cannot exist without a judge and the power to create a court embraces the power to create the office of judge thereof\n",
      "a court cannot be established until it has a judge and unless the things required by the constitution for the existence of a court concur the court exist the power to create a court ordinarily implies the power to create the office of judge thereof and to confer jurisdiction\n",
      "27 since the authority to create courts is an attribute of sovereignty the power can be exercised under the constitution or under a constitutionally valid statute the power to create courts carries with it the power to organise courts which would include the power to appoint the presiding officers for the courts but as stated earlier while the words court and judge are often used interchangeably they are not strictly speaking synonymous the following observation illustrates the distinction\n",
      "a court is an instrumentality of government it is a creation of the law and in some respects it is an imaginary thing that exists only in legal contemplation very similar to a corporation a time when a place where and the persons by whom judicial functions are to be exercised are essential to complete the idea of a court it is in its organized aspect with all these constituent elements of time place and officers that completes the idea of a court in the general legal acceptation of the term but a court may exist in legal contemplation without any officers charged with the duty of administering justice the officers might all die or resign and still the legal fiction would continue to exist the judge of a court while presiding over the court is by common courtesy called the court and the words the court and the judge or judges are frequently used in the status as synonymous state ex rel maer v city of cincinati 19 ne 2d 902  60 ohio app 119\n",
      "28 thus when complete in its organised aspect with all the constituent elements of time place and officers that court is constituted in the general legal acceptation of the term this is true of the initial constitution only thereafter the court will exist even if the court is without a judge by reason of the judicial officer having vacated officer on resignation or retirement or removal or the like\n",
      "the provision as to the constitution of the court at the initial stage as contemplated by section 36 must therefore be understood to mean that all its constituent elements of time place and officers are complete and unless the judge expected to man the court is appointed the constitution cannot be said to be complete because the court cannot take off till then the initial constitution becomes complete only when the requirements of both subs 1 and 2 of s 36 have been completed for these reasons we are in agreement with the view expressed by daud j in this behalf\n",
      "29 but the main reason which motivated the supreme court legal aid society to file this petition uart 32 of the constitution was the delay in the disposal of cases under the act involving foreigners the reliefs claimed included a direction to treat further detention of foreigners who were languishing in jails as undertrials under the act for a period exceeding two years as void or in any case they be released on bail and it was further submitted by counsel that their cases be given priority over others when the petition came up for admission it was pointed out to counsel that such an invidious distinction between similarly situate undertrials who are citizens of this country and who are foreigners may not be permissible under the constitution and even if priority is accorded to the cases of foreigners it may have the effect of foreigners being permitted to jump the queue and slide down cases of citizens even if their cases are old and pending since long counsel immediately realised that such a distinction if drawn would result in cases of indian citizens being further delayed at the behest of foreigners a procedure which may not be consistent with law\n",
      "he further rightly sought permission to amend the cause title and prayer clauses of the petition which was permitted in substance the petitioner now prays that all undertrials who are in jail for the commission of any offence or offences under the act for a period exceeding two years on account of the delay in the disposal of cases lodged against them should be forthwith released from jail declaring their further detention to be illegal and void and pending decision of this court on the said larger issue they should in any case be released on bail\n",
      "30 it is indeed true and that is obvious from the plain language of s 361 of the act that the legislature contemplated the creation of special courts to speed up the trial of those prosecuted for the commission of any offence under the act it is equally true that similar is the objective of s 309 of the code it is also true that this court has emphasised in a series of decisions that articles 14 19 and 21 sustain and nourish each other and any law depriving a person of personal liberty must prescribe a procedure which is just fair and reasonable ie a procedure which promotes speedy trial hussainara khatoon iv v home secy state of bihar  1979 indlaw sc 112  1979 indlaw sc 112 raghubir singh v state of bihar  1986 indlaw sc 617  1986 indlaw sc 617 and kadra pahadiya v state of bihar  1981 indlaw sc 507  1981 indlaw sc 507 to quote only a few this is also the avowed objective of s 361 of the act\n",
      "however this laudable objective got frustrated when the state government delayed the constitution of sufficient number of special courts in greater bombay the process of constituting the first two special courts started with the issuance of notifications under s 361 on 411991 and under s 362 on 641991 almost two years from 2951989 when amending act 2 of 1989 became effective\n",
      "31 since the number of courts constituted to try offences under the act were not sufficient and the appointments of judges to man these courts were delayed cases piled up and the provision in regard to enlargement on bail being strict the offenders have had to languish in jails for want of trials as stated earlier s 37 of the act makes every offence punishable under the act cognizable and nonbailable and provides that no person accused of an offence punishable for a term of five years or more shall be released on bail unless\n",
      "i the public prosecutor has had an opportunity to oppose bail and\n",
      "ii if opposed the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of the offence and is not likely to indulge in similar activity on account of the strict language of the said provision very few persons accused of certain offences under the act could secure bail now to refuse bail on the one hand and to delay trial of cases on the other is clearly unfair and unreasonable and contrary to the spirit of s 361 of the act s 309 of the code and articles 14 19 and 21 of the constitution we are conscious of the statutory provision finding place in s 37 of the act prescribing the conditions which have to be satisfied before a person accused of an offence under the act can be released indeed we have adverted to this section in the earlier part of the judgment\n",
      "32 we have also kept in mind the interpretation placed on a similar provision in s 20 of the tada act by the constitution bench in kartar singh v state of punjab  1994 indlaw sc 525  1994 indlaw sc 525 despite this provision we have directed as above mainly at the call of art 21 as the right to speedy trial may even require in some cases quashing of a criminal proceeding altogether as held by a constitution bench of this court in a r antulay v r s nayak  1991 indlaw sc 313  1991 indlaw sc 313 release on bail which can be taken to be embedded in the right of speedy trial may in some cases be the demand of art 21 as we have not felt inclined to accept the extreme submission of quashing the proceedings and setting free the accused whose trials have been delayed beyond reasonable time for reasons already alluded to we have felt that deprivation of the personal liberty without ensuring speedy trial would also not be in consonance with the right guaranteed by art 21 of course some amount of deprivation of personal liberty cannot be avoided in such cases but if the period of deprivation pending trial becomes unduly long the fairness assured by art 21 would receive a jolt\n",
      "it is because of this that we have felt that after accused persons have suffered imprisonment which is half of the maximum punishment provided for the offence any further deprivation of personal liberty would be violative of the fundamental right visualised by article 21 which has to be telescoped with the right guaranteed by art 14 which also promises justness fairness and reasonableness in procedural matters what then is the remedy  the offences under the act are grave and therefore we are not inclined to agree with the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that we should quash the prosecutions and set free the accused persons whose trials are delayed beyond reasonable time alternatively he contended that such accused persons whose trials have been delayed beyond reasonable time and are likely to be further delayed should be released on bail on such terms as this court considers appropriate to impose this suggestion commends to us we were told by the learned counsel for the state of maharashtra that additional special courts have since been constituted but having regard to the large pendency of such cases in the state we are afraid this is not likely to make a significant dent in the huge pile of such cases\n",
      "33 we therefore direct as underi where the undertrial is accused of an offences under the act prescribing a punishment of imprisonment of five years or less and find such an undertrial shall be released on bail if he has been in jail for a period which is not less than half of the punishment provided for the offence with which he is charged and where he is charged with more than one offence the offence providing the highest punishment if the offence with which he is charged prescribes the maximum fine the bail amount shall be 50 of the said amount with two sureties for like amount if the maximum fine is not prescribed bail shall be to the satisfaction of the special judge concerned with two sureties for like amount\n",
      "ii where the undertrial accused is charged with an offences under the act providing for punishment exceeding five years and fine such an undertrial shall be released on bail on the term set out in i above provided that his bail amount shall in no case be less than rs 50 000 with two sureties for like amount\n",
      "iii where the undertrial accused is charged with an offences under the act punishable with minimum imprisonment of ten years and a minimum find of rupees of one lakh such an undertrial shall be released on bail if he has been in jail for not less than five years provided he furnishes bail in the sum of rupees one lakh with two sureties for the like amount\n",
      "iv where an undertrial accused is charged for the commission of an offence punishable uss 31 and 31a of the act such an undertrial shall not be entitled to be released on bail by virtue of this order\n",
      "34 the directives in clauses i ii and iii above shall be subject to the following general conditions\n",
      "i the undertrial accused entitled to be released on bail shall deposit his passport with the learned judge of the special court concerned and if he does not hold a passport he shall file an affidavit to that effect in the form that may be prescribed by the learned special judge in the latter case the learned special judge will if he has reason to doubt the accuracy of the statement write to the passport officer concerned to verify the statement and the passport officer shall verify his record and send a reply within three weeks if he fails to reply with the said time the learned special judge will be entitled to act on the statement of the undertrial accused\n",
      "ii the undertrial accused shall on being released on bail present himself at the police station which has prosecuted him at least once in a month in the case of those covered under clause i once in a fortnight in the case of those covered by cl \n",
      "ii and once in a week in the case of those covered by clause iii unless leave of absence is obtained in advance from the special judge concerned\n",
      "iii the benefit of the direction in cls ii and iii shall not be available to those accused persons who are in the opinion of the learned special judge for reasons to be stated in writing likely to temper with evidence or influence the prosecution witnesses\n",
      "iv in the case of undertrial accused who are foreigners the special judge shall besides impounding their passports insist on a certificate of assurance from the embassyhigh commission of the country to which the foreigner belongs that the said accused shall not leave the country and shall appear before the special court as and when required\n",
      "v the undertrial accused shall not leave the area in relation to which the special court is constituted except with the permission of the learned special judge\n",
      "vi the undertrial accused may furnish bail by depositing cash equal to the bail amount\n",
      "vii the special judge will be at liberty to cancel bail if any of the above conditions are violated or a case for cancellation of bail is otherwise made out and\n",
      "viii after the release of the undertrial accused pursuant to this order the cases of those undertrials who have not been released and are in jail will be accorded priority and the special court will proceed with them as provided in s 309 of the code\n",
      "35 we may state that the above are intended to operate as onetime directions for cases in which the accused persons are in jail and their trials are delayed they are not intended to interfere with the special courts power to grant bail under s 37 of the act the special court will be free to exercise that power keeping in view the complaint of inordinate delay in the disposal of the pending cases the special court will notwithstanding the directions be free to cancel bail if the accused is found to be misusing it and grounds for cancellation of bail exist lastly we grant liberty to apply in case of any difficulty in the implementation of this order\n",
      "36 we are conscious of the fact that the menace of drug trafficking has to be controlled by providing stringent punishments and those who indulge in such nefarious activities do not deserve any sympathy but at the same time we cannot be oblivious to the fact that many innocent persons may also be languishing in jails if we recall to mind the percentage of acquittals since harsh punishments have been provided for under the act the percentage of disposals on plea of guilt is bound to be small the stage government should therefore have realised the need for setting up sufficient number of special courts immediately after the amendment of the act by amending act 2 of 1989 even after the division bench of the bombay high court refused to grant en bloc enlargement on bail on 121993 in criminal application no 3480 of 1992 and b d criminal no 565 of 1992 no substantial improvement in the pendency is shown since new cases continue to pour in and therefore a onetime exercise has become imperative to place the system on an even keel\n",
      "we also recommend to the state government to set up review committees headed by a judicial officer preferably a retired high court judge with one or two other members to review the cases of undertrials who have been in jail for long including those released under this order and to recommend to the state government which of the cases deserve withdrawal the state government can then advise the public prosecutor to move the court for withdrawal of such cases this will not only help reduce the pendency but will also increase the credibility of the prosecuting agency after giving effect to this order the special court may consider giving priority to cases of those undertrials who continue in jail despite this order on account of their inability to furnish bail\n",
      "37 we dispose of the petition insofar as it relates to the state of maharashtra but we are told that the situation is equally grave with varying degrees in certain other states like the states of andhra pradesh assam kerala karnataka gujarat orissa bihar west bengal uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh we direct notices to issue to these states through their chief secretaries to furnish information in the pro forma appended hereto to enable this court to decide if similar action is called for the information must be furnished within 4 weeks duly verified to be correct by an officer of the department concerned not below the rank of a deputy secretary\n",

      "4 whether the market act can apply to the transactions of purchase of sugarcane and sale of sugar and molasses by the appellant sugar mills in view of the fact that regulation of these transactions is already effected by bihar sugarcane regulation of supply and purchase act 1981 for short sugarcane act as well as and sugar both issued us 3 of the essential commodities act 1955 hereinafter referred to as the essential commodities act and also under the provisions of bihar molasses control act 1947 in the alternative whether imposition of market fee under the market act by the respective market committees is justified in the absence of any service rendered to the appellant sugar mills under the provisions of the market act and consequently the levy of market fee can be said to be not supported by any quid pro quo\n",
      "5 rival contentions\n",
      "learned senior counsel for the appellants vehemently submitted in support of the aforesaid twin contentions that the market act which was enacted by the bihar legislature under entries 26 and 27 of the state list read with entry 28 therein had to be read subject to entry 33 of the concurrent list and as the bihar legislature itself had enacted the sugar act in exercise of its legislative powers under entry 33 of the concurrent list there was no occasion left for the state of bihar to get satisfied about the need to regulate the production and sale of sugarcane as well as manufactured items therefrom as per the market act in short the invocation of s 3 read with s 4 of the market act was totally misconceived and uncalled for it was further contended that once the state of bihar in exercise of its power of exemption us 42 of the market act had exempted the appellant sugar factories from applicability of s 18 of the market act the entire machinery under the market act became inapplicable to regulate the sale and purchase of transactions concerning sugarcane sugar and molasses as entered into by the appellant sugar factories consequently there remained no occasion for the authorities functioning under the market act for demanding any market fee from the appellants us 27 of the market act it was also contended in further support of this submission that the sugarcane control order 1966 as well as the sugar control order of the same year issued us 3 of the essential commodities act 1955 and also the provisions of the bihar molasses control act 1947 fully occupied the field of regulation of sale and purchase of sugarcane sugar and molasses and on that ground also the provisions of the market act could not be pressed in service against the appellant sugar factories undertaking the purchase and sale of the concerned transactions\n",
      "6 in the alternative it was contended that once s 15 of the market act is out of picture and once it remains an admitted position that the appellant sugar factories have to purchase sugarcane from purchase centres there remains no occasion for the market committees to give any services under the market act to the appellant sugar factories hence the market committees were not entitled to recover any market fee from the appellants as there was no return benefit or quid pro quo made available to the appellants by the market committees and hence the impugned market fee in substance became a tax which could not be recovered under the market act by the market committees\n",
      "replying to these contentions learned senior counsel for the state of bihar and learned senior counsel appearing for the market committees submitted that the appellant sugar factories have no locus standi to maintain these proceedings for the simple reason that so far as their challenges to the levy of market fee on transactions of sale of sugar and molasses were concerned as us 27 of the market act levy was imposed on the buyers of sugar and molasses manufactured by the appellant companies these sugar mills were not affected by the levy that the appellant companies may at the highest be collecting agents of market fee if the buyers were not licensed under the act but in most of the cases the appellant sugar companies were selling levy sugar to the food corporation of india and even free sugar was mostly sold by them to licensed buyers same was the case of sale of molasses to the concerned buyers they however rightly conceded that the appellants cannot be said to be not having any locus standi to challenge the market fee levied on their purchase of sugarcane as the charge of market fee would be on them as buyers of sugarcane\n",
      "7 on the merits of the contentions raised by learned senior counsel for the appellants learned senior counsel for the respondents submitted that even if the exemption notification us 42 of the act purports to exempt the appellant sugar companies from whole of s 15 of the market act in substance the exemption is confined to s 152 of the act as there is already a declaration under s 4 of the market act treating the purchase centres of the appellant sugar companies at the factory gates as well as at other places in the market area as submarket yards on a conjoint reading of these two notifications therefore it can be seen that exemption us 42 of the act was confined to excluding the operation of s 152 of the act qua these sugar factories in the alternative it was submitted that if the exemption notification is treated to cover entire s 15 even then once the transactions of sale and purchase take place within the market area charge us 27 would get settled on these transactions it was further submitted that there is enough return benefit made available to the sugar factories admittedly situated within the market area that in fact their service centres are also declared to be submarket yards even beyond the factory gate that they utilise the link roads made available by the market committee for bringing sugarcane produce to the factory premises by giving facility of swift transportation thus the sugarcane as a raw material is brought to the factory premises before it gets dried up this yields better quality and larger quantity of sugar and molasses\n",
      "8 in addition thereto facilities of supply of necessary information regarding the prevalent prices of sugarcane are made available by the market committee but even apart from that the market committee can act as a mediator in enabling the sugarcane growers to get better price of sugarcane above the minimum price fixed under the control order and the sugarcane act and this role of the market committee would be beneficial not only to the producers of sugarcane but also to the factories which can be assured of appropriate good quality sugarcane purchased from the sugarcane growers it is therefore wrong to suggest that there is no quid pro quo between the charge of market fee and the payment thereof by the sugarcane factories that the infrastructural facilities made available to the industry as a whole have to be seen and transactions are not to be dissected for finding out the quid pro quo between charging of the market fee and the burden thereof borne by the sugar companies it was therefore contended that none of the submissions canvassed by learned senior counsel for the appellants deserved to be accepted in the light of the aforesaid rival contentions we now proceed to deal with the twin contentions submitted for our consideration by learned senior counsel for the appellants in support of these appeals however before we deal with the merits of these contentions the question of locus standi of the appellants is required to be considered at the outset\n",
      "9 locus standi of the appellants to maintain these proceedings\n",
      "it has to be kept in view that as per s 27 of the market act the charge of the market fee is on the buyer of the agricultural produce bought or sold in the market area the said section reads as under\n",
      "power to levy fees  1 the market committee shall levy and collect market fees on the agricultural produce bought or sold in the market area at the rate of rupee one per rs100 worth of agricultural produce\n",
      "xxxxx xxxx xxxx\n",
      "2 the market fee chargeable under subs 1 shall be payable by the buyer in the manner prescribed\n",
      "3 the fee chargeable under subs 1 shall not be levied more than once on a notified agricultural produce in the same notified market area\n",
      "10 it is not in dispute between the parties that sugarcane is an agricultural produce as it is grown in fields by the cultivators both sugarcane and sugar are listed as item nos 1 and 3 in para xii dealing with miscellaneous items as found in the schedule to the market act enacted as per s 21a of the act\n",
      "s 21a of the act defines agricultural produ as under  agricultural produce means all produce whether processed or nonprocessed manufactured or not of agriculture horticulture plantation animal husbandry forest sericulture pisciculture and includes livestock or poultry as specified in the schedule\n",
      "12 in the light of the aforesaid provisions it is obvious that the sugar factories operating in the market area within the jurisdiction of the market committee concerned can be said to be buyers of sugarcane an agricultural produce their purchase centres are situated within the market area as submitted by learned senior counsel for the respondents all the purchase centres at which the appellant sugar factories purchase sugarcane as raw material are not only situated within the market area but are also declared as submarket yards in fact the entire bihar state is comprised of various market areas within the jurisdiction of different market committees if that is so it has to be held that when the charge us 27 of paying market fee is imposed on the sugar factories as buyers of sugarcane within the market area they have to be treated to be having sufficient locus standi as buyers of sugarcane to challenge the imposition of market fee on their purchase transactions on this aspect learned senior counsel for the respondents did not contest\n",
      "however their submission was that when purchased sugarcane is processed at the factories and converted into sugar and molasses and when such sugar and molasses are sold by the sugar factories the charge of market fee on these sale transactions would settle on the buyers of sugar and molasses who have not made any grievance about payment of market fee that may be so however the fact remains that if the sugar factories sell manufactured sugar and molasses out of the purchased raw materialsugarcane and if the buyers are not licensed then as per the provisions of rule 82 iii of the bihar agricultural produce markets rules 1975 the sugar factories as sellers have to realise the market fee from the buyers and have to deposit the same with the market committees that obligation by itself would give sufficient locus standi to the sugar factories which sell sugar and molasses within the market area to challenge the aforesaid statutory obligation imposed on them by the act and the rules and to submit as to how they are not covered by the provisions of the act it may be that when they sell levy sugar to the food corporation of india they may not have to undertake this liability as collecting agents of the market committee so far as the market fee is concerned still even if partially in case of sale of free sugar to unlicensed buyers they have to be called upon to discharge their statutory obligation under rule 82 iii it cannot be said that they have no locus standi to challenge the imposition of market fee on the transactions of sale effected by them in connection with sugar and molasses the preliminary objection of learned senior counsel for the respondents against the locus standi of the appellants to maintain these proceedings is therefore overruled this takes us to the consideration of the main twin contentions canvassed by learned senior counsel for the appellants for our consideration\n",
      "13 contention no 1  applicability of the market act to appellants transaction of purchase of sugarcane and sale of sugar and molasses\n",
      "so far as this contention is concerned we have to keep in view the relevant provisions of the market act sugar act as well as the orders under the essential commodities act in the first instance we shall deal with the transactions of purchase of sugarcane by the sugar factories functioning in the market areas falling within the jurisdiction of respective market committees constituted under the market act the market act has been enacted by the bihar legislature as per the legislative power vested in it by entries 26 27 and 28 of list ii of seventh schedule of the constitution these entries read as under  26 trade and commerce within the state subject to the provisions of entry 33 of list iii 27 production supply and distribution of goods subject to the provisions of entry 33 of list iii 28 markets and fairs\n",
      "14 it becomes at once clear that if location of markets and fairs simpliciter and the management and maintenance thereof are only contemplated by the market act then they would fall squarely within the topic of legislative power envisaged by entry 28 of list ii however the market act as we will presently show deals with supply and distribution of goods as well as trade and commerce therein as it seeks to regulate the sale and purchase of agricultural produce to be carried on in the specified markets under the act to that extent the provisions of entry 33 of list iii override the legislative powers of the state legislature in connection with legislations dealing with trade and commerce in and the production supply and distribution of goods once we turn to entry 33 of the concurrent list we find that on the topic of trade and commerce in and the production supply and distribution of goods enumerated therein at subclause b we find listed items of foodstuffs including edible oilseeds and oils thus to the extent to which the market act seeks to regulate the transactions of sale and purchase of sugarcane and sugar which are foodstuffs and trade and commerce therein it has to be held that the market act being enacted under the topics of legislative powers under entries 26 27 and 28 of list ii will be subject to any other legislation under entry 33 of the concurrent list as it will be seen hereinafter the bihar legislature itself has enacted the sugarcane act in exercise of its legislative powers under entry 33 of the concurrent list and therefore the field covered by the sugarcane act would obviously remain exclusively governed by the sugarcane act and to the extent the latter act carves out an independent field for its operation the sweep of the general field covered by the market act which covers all types of agricultural produce would pro tanto get excluded qua sugarcane and the products prepared out of it so far as the market act is concerned it is necessary to note that it is an act to provide for better regulation of buying and selling of agricultural produce and the establishment of markets for agricultural produce in the state of bihar and for matters connected therewith\n",
      "15 the said act is enacted essentially to protect the growers of agricultural produce in the state who on account of their ignorance illiteracy and lack of collective bargaining power may get exploited by middlemen and economically strong purchasers of their agricultural produce with the result that the agriculturists may not get adequate price for their produce it is with that end in view that the market act has been enacted the constitutional validity of the madras commercial crops markets act concerned with the regulation of purchase and sale of commercial crops grown by agriculturists was considered by a constitution bench of this court in the case of mcvs arunachala nadar etc vs the state of madras  others 1959 supp1 scr 92 1958 indlaw sc 59 subba rao j speaking for the court while upholding the constitutional validity of the said act emphasised the necessity of such enactment with a view to protect the producers of commercial crops from being exploited by the middlemen and profiteers and to enable them to secure a fair return for their produce the learned judge referred to with approval the following recommendations of royal commission on agriculture in india appointed in 1928 that cultivator suffers from many handicaps  to begin with he is illiterate and in general ignorant of prevailing prices in the markets especially in regard to commercial crops the most hopeful solution of the cultivators marketing difficulties seems to lie in the improvement of communications and the establishment of regulated markets and we recommend for the consideration of other provinces the establishment of regulated markets on the berar system as modified by the bombay legislation the establishment of regulated markets must form an essential part of any ordered plan of agricultural development in this country the bombay act is however definitely limited to cotton markets and the bulk of the transactions in berar market is also in that crop we consider that the system can conveniently be extended to other crops and with a view to avoiding difficulties would suggest that regulated markets should only be established under provincial legislation\n",
      "16 reference was also made to the report of an expert committee appointed by the government of madras which graphically described the difficulties of the cultivators and their dependence upon the middlemen the following is the extract from the report of the expert committee as noted by subba rao j for highlighting the need for regulated markets for cultivators of commercial crops the middleman plays a prominent part in sale transactions and his terms and methods vary according to the nature of the crop and the status of the cultivator the rich ryot who is unencumbered by debt and who has comparatively large stocks to dispose of brings his produce to the taluk or district centre and entrusts it to a commission agent for sale if it is not sold on the day on which it is brought it is stored in the commission agents godown at the cultivators expense and as the latter generally cannot afford to wait about until the sale is effected he leaves his produce to be sold by the commission agent at the best possible price and it is doubtful whether eventually he receives the best price the middle class ryot invariably disposes of his produce through the same agency but unlike the rich ryot he is not free to choose his commission agent because he generally takes advances from a particular commission agent on the condition that he will hand over his produce to him for sale not only therefore he places himself in a position where he cannot dictate and insist on the sale being effected for the highest price but he loses by being compelled to pay heavy interest on the advance taken from the commission agent his relations with middlemen are more akin to those between a creditor and a debtor than of a selling agent and producer in almost all cases of the poor ryots the major portion of their produce finds its way into the hands of the village moneylender and whatever remains is sold to petty traders who tour the villages and the price at which it changes hands is governed not so much by the market rates but by the urgent needs of the ryot which are generally taken advantage of by the purchaser the dominating position which the middleman occupies and his methods of sale and the terms of his dealings have long ago been realized\n",
      "17 relying on the aforesaid observations subba rao j speaking for the constitution bench justified the need for such legislations and upheld the act by laying down as under  the aforesaid observations describe the pitiable dependence of the middleclass and poor ryots on the middlemen and petty traders with the result that the cultivators are not able to find markets for their produce wherein they can expect reasonable price for them with a view to provide satisfactory conditions for the growers of commercial crops to sell their produce on equal terms and at reasonable prices the act was passed on july 25 1933 the preamble introduces the act with the recital that it is expedient to provide for the better regulation of the buying and selling of commercial crops in the presidency of madras and for that purpose to establish markets and make rules for their proper administration the act therefore was the result of a long exploratory investigation by experts in the field conceived and enacted to regulate the buying and selling of commercial crops by providing suitable and regulated markets by eliminating middlemen and bringing face to face the producer and the buyer so that they meet on equal terms thereby eradicating or at any rate reducing the scope for exploitation in dealings such a statute cannot be said to create unreasonable restrictions on the citizens right to do business unless it is clearly established that the provisions are too drastic unnecessarily harsh and overreach the scope of the object to achieve which it is enacted\n",
      "18 it therefore cannot be gainsaid that the need to have a regulated market where the agriculturist who grows sugarcane as a commercial crop can be assured of adequate price of the sugarcane produced by him and may not be exploited by middlemen would justify the enactment of the protective umbrella of the market act however if the act had stood by itself no legitimate grievance could have been made by anyone on this score but so far as the facts of the present cases are concerned the very same bihar legislature enacted the sugarcane act of 1981 which has operated simultaneously with the market act for the entire state the said latter act is obviously enacted by the very same legislature in exercise of its legislative powers under entry 33 of the concurrent list it is of course true that the union parliament has not passed any similar legislation in exercise of its concurrent legislative power under the very same entry 33 of list iii we will therefore have to see to what extent the sugarcane act which is a latter act has carved out a field for itself for protecting the sugarcane growers resulting in withdrawing the same subject matter from the general sweep of the market act which covers not only sugarcane but also number of other agricultural produce in this connection s 3 of the market act requires to be noted it reads as under  3 notification of intention of exercising control over purchase sale storage and processing of agricultural produce in specified area \n",
      "1 notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other act for the time being in force the state government may by notification declare its intention of regulating the purchase sale storage and processing of such agricultural produce and in such area as may be specified in the notification\n",
      "2 a notification under subs 1 shall state that any objection or suggestion which may be received by the state government within a period of not less than two months to be specified in the notification shall be considered by the state government\n",
      "19 as per the aforesaid provisions it has to be kept in view by the state government concerned while forming the requisite intention whether there is any special legislation of the same state legislature holding the field and serving the very same purpose of regulating such transactions mr shanti bhushan learned senior counsel for the appellant vehemently contended that the bihar legislature itself had enacted the sugarcane act of 1981 whereunder adequate provision was made for regulating the purchase sale storage and processing of sugarcane the complete machinery was provided thereunder for protecting the sugarcane growers and therefore there was no occasion for the state of bihar to continue the regulation of purchase and sale transactions of sugarcane atleast after 1981 as per s 31 of the market act the preamble of the sugarcane act shows that amongst others it is enacted to regulate the production supply and distribution of sugarcane intended for use in sugar factories and taxation of sugarcane and matters incidental thereto chapter ii of the sugarcane act provides for administrative machinery for carrying out the purposes of the act s 3 thereof deals with establishment of sugarcane board s 4 lays down the functions of the board  1 the board shall advise the state government on the following matters namely \n",

      "33 the aforesaid provisions therefore clearly indicate that the need for regulating the purchase sale storage and processing of sugarcane being an agricultural produce is completely met by the comprehensive machinery provided by the sugarcane act enacted by the very same legislature which enacted the general act being the market act once that conclusion is reached it becomes obvious that the market act which is an enabling act empowering the state authorities to extend the regulatory net of the said act to notified agricultural produce as per s 31 will get its general sweep curtailed to the extent the special act being the sugarcane act enacted by the very same legislature carves out a special field and provides special machinery for regulating the purchase and sale of the specified agricultural produce namely sugarcane it has also to be kept in view that the very heart of the market act is s 15 of the act which reads as under  15 sale of agricultural produce  1 no agricultural produce specified in notification under subs 1 of section 4 shall be made bought or sold by any person at any place within the market area other than the relevant principal market yard or submarket yard or yards established therein except such quantity as may on this behalf be prescribed for retail sale or personal consumption\n",
      "2 the sale and purchase of such agricultural produce in such areas shall not withstanding anything contained in any law be made by means of open auction or tender system except in cases of such class or description of produce as may be exempted by the board\n",
      "34 it is this section which enables the market committee concerned to monitor and regulate the sale and purchase of the agricultural commodity which is covered by the protective umbrella of the act once such an agricultural produce is brought for sale in the market yard or submarket yard the sale is to be effected by auction or by inviting tenders such a scheme is in direct conflict with the scheme of the sugarcane act wherein there is no question of sugar factory being called upon to enter into a public auction for purchasing sugarcane which is specially earmarked for it out of the reserved area in fact provisions of the sugarcane act and the provisions of the market act especially s 15 read with s 31 cannot harmoniously coexist it is precisely to avoid such a possible conflict and headon collision between general act namely the market act and the special act namely the sugarcane act which was later on enacted in 1981 by the very same bihar legislature that the state government in exercise of its exemption power us 42 of the market act issued a notification dated 22nd march 1976 to the following effect so 550 the 22nd march 1976 published in bihar gazette exorder dated 2331976 \n",
      "in exercise of the powers conferred us 42 of the bihar agricultural produce markets act 1960 the governor of bihar is pleased to exempt all sugar mills from the provisions of s 15 of the bihar agricultural produce markets act 1960 with regard to their sale and purchase of agricultural produce notified under subs 1 of s 4 of the said act\n",
      "35 this very notification shows that the state government had given up its erstwhile intention of regulating the sale and purchase of sugarcane as per s 31 of the market act which could not survive any further after the issuance of the aforesaid exemption notification it is easy to visualise that the market committee can control purchase sale storage and processing of agricultural produce in the specified area under the market act only when the sale and purchase of agricultural produce can be effected as per s 15 in the principal market yard or submarket yard market is defined by s 21h of the market act which reads as under  market means a market established under this act for the market area and includes a principal market yard and submarket yard or yards if any it is at such market yard that the regulation of sale and purchase of agricultural produce shall be effected as required by s 15 once s 15 is out of picture the mere declaration of market area as per s 4 and the general declaration of intention to regulate purchase sale storage and processing of agricultural produce like sugarcane as per s 3 of the market act or declaration of market yard or submarket yards as per s 5 would remain an empty formality or would represent an empty eggshell with its contents taken out the entire machinery of the market act would be rendered redundant qua agricultural produce to which s 15 does not apply s 15 is the heart and soul of the act\n",
      "36 due to its inapplicability to a given agricultural produce there would remain no occasion for the market committee concerned to exercise its regulatory functions for such a produce this is the precise result which has ensued regarding regulation of purchase and sale of sugarcane by the market committee concerned in view of the combined operation of the relevant provisions of the sugarcane act and the exemption notification us 42 of the market act excluding the application of s 15 of the market act to the sale and purchase transactions of sugarcane in the market area it is not possible to agree with learned senior counsel for the respondents that notification us 42 of the act in substance excludes only the applicability of s 152 on the express wordings of the said notification it is not possible to countenance this contention even if declaration under s 5 treating the premises of the sugar factories and the purchase centres from which they have to purchase sugarcane as per the sugarcane act is to be held to be operative such a declaration would be devoid of any efficacy under the market act as the very purpose of the declaration of such market yard would not get fructified once sugarcane will not be required to be brought for purchase and sale in such declared market yard it has to be kept in view that the relevant provisions of the market act laying down the machinery for effecting the regulation of purchase sale storage and processing of agricultural produce cannot be of any avail once purchase and sale of such an agricultural produce are not required to be effected at the relevant market yard and have not to be subjected to open auction or tender for fixing proper prices for such agricultural produce to be paid to the growers of such produce it must therefore be held that the entire machinery of the market act cannot apply to the transactions of purchase of sugarcane by the appellant sugar factories as they are fully covered by the special provisions of the sugarcane act\n",
      "37 it is also necessary to note that if both these acts are treated to be simultaneously applying to cover sale and purchase of sugarcane the possibility of a clear conflict of decisions of officers and authorities acting under the sugarcane act on the one hand and the market act on the other would arise these authorities acting under both the state acts dealing with the same subjectmatter and covering the same transactions may come to independent diverse conclusions and none of them being subordinate to the other may create a situation wherein there may be headon collision between the decisions and the orders of these authorities acting on their own in the hierarchy of the respective statutory provisions for example the marketing inspector may find that weighment of sugarcane was not proper at a given point of time while the cane officer may find to the contrary in the hierarchy of proceedings under the market act the market committee may take one decision with respect to the same subject matter for which the collector exercising appellate powers under the sugarcane act may take a contrary decision this would create an irreconcilable conflict of decisions with consequential confusion so far as the buyers and sellers of agricultural producesugarcane are concerned it is of no avail to contend as submitted by learned counsel for the respondents that for avoiding such conflicts s 15 is dispensed with by the state in exercise of its power us 42 of the market act whether such an exemption can be granted by the state us 42 or not is not a relevant consideration for deciding the moot question whether the statutory scheme of the market act can harmoniously coexist with the statutory scheme of the sugarcane act as enacted by the very same legislature it is possible to visualise that the state authorities may not exercise powers us 42 of the act in such an eventuality the sugarcane act would not countenance a public auction of sugarcane to be supplied by cane grower to the earmarked factory for which sugarcane is grown in the reserved area on the other hand the market act would require the very same sugarcane to be brought to the market yard for being sold at the public auction to the highest bidder who may not be the sugar factory itself thus what is reserved for the sugar factory by way of raw material by the sugarcane act would get dereserved by the sweep of s 15 of the market act\n",
      "38 to avoid such a headon conflict it has to be held that the market act is a general act covering all types of agricultural produce listed in the schedule to the act but out of the listed items if any of the agricultural produce like sugarcane is made subjectmatter of a special enactment laying down an independent exclusive machinery for regulating sale purchase and storage of such a commodity under a special act then the special act would prevail over the general act for that commodity and by necessary implication will take the said commodity out of the sweep of the general act therefore learned counsel for the appellants are right when they submit that because of the sugarcane act the regulation of sale and purchase of sugarcane has to be carried out exclusively under the sugarcane act and the said transactions would be out of the general sweep of the market act none of its machinery would be available to regulate these transactions but even apart from the provisions of the sugarcane act learned senior counsel for the appellants also placed reliance on the sugarcane control order 1966 enacted under the provisions of s 3 of the essential commodities act 1955 for submitting that purchase and sale of sugarcane is also controlled by the aforesaid central government order issued under the essential commodities act and consequently the said provision would supersede the general provisions of the market act we therefore now proceed to consider this submission sugarcane control order 1966 is issued by the central government in exercise of powers conferred by s 3 of the essential commodities act 1955 cl 2 subcl c defines factory and reads as under  factory means any premises including the precincts thereto in any part of which sugar is manufactured by vacuum pan process\n",
      "39 price is defined by subcl g thereof which reads as under  price means the price or the minimum price fixed by the central government from time to time for sugarcane delivered cl 3 of the order deals with the fixation of minimum price by the central government for making it payable by purchaser of sugar to the sugarcane growers clause 3a deals with rebate that can be deducted by purchaser of sugar from the price to be paid to the sugarcane grower or the sugarcane growers cooperative society rebate provided therein pertains to the minimum price of sugarcane fixed under clause 3 or the price agreed to between the producer or his agent and the sugarcane grower or the sugarcane growers cooperative society there is a provision for additional price to be paid to the sugarcane grower by the purchaser of sugarcane as laid down in cl 5 clause 5a deals with additional price for sugarcane purchased on or after 1st october 1974 by the producer of sugar cl 6 deals with power of the central government by order to regulate distribution and movement of sugarcane as per this clause the central government can by order direct the sugarcane growers to supply the earmarked quantity of sugarcane grown by them in the reserved area fixed for sugar factories to ensure continuous supply of sugarcane as raw material to such factories this provision is parallel to the statutory provisions enacted by the bihar legislature in the sugarcane act referred to earlier by us cl 9 refers to the power of the central government or any person authorised in this behalf to call for information from various sources as enacted therein clause 9a deals with the power of entry search and seizure of premises which obviously has to be exercised for fructifying the purposes of the act cl 11 deals with delegation of powers by the central government to any officer or authority thereof or to any state government or any officerauthority of a state government the aforesaid relevant provisions of the sugarcane control order show that it seeks to lay down the minimum guaranteed price of sugarcane to the sugarcane growers with a corresponding obligation on them to supply sugarcane to the earmarked factories for which the reserved areas can be fixed\n",
      "40 this order also contemplates negotiated price between the sugarcane growers on the one hand and the sugarcane factories on the other for whom fixed quota of sugarcane can be earmarked it has to be appreciated that the aforesaid provisions of the sugarcane control order operate in the same field in which the bihar legislative enactment namely the sugarcane act operates and both of them are complementary to each other when taken together they wholly occupy the field of regulation of price of sugarcane and also the mode and manner in which sugarcane has to be supplied and distributed to the earmarked sugar factories and thus lay down a comprehensive scheme of regulating purchase and sale of sugarcane to be supplied by sugarcane growers to the earmarked sugar factories it is however true that comprehensive procedure or machinery for enforcing these provisions is found in greater detail in the sugarcane act of the bihar legislation but on a combined operation of both these provisions it becomes at once clear that the general provisions of the market act so far as the regulation of sale and purchase of sugarcane is concerned get obviously excluded and superseded by these special provisions in this connection we may refer to a decision of the karnataka high court in the case of vasavi traders vs state of karnataka  ors 1982 2 karnataka law journal 357 in that case venkatachaliah j as he then was speaking for a division bench of the karnataka high court considered the impact of sugarcane control order on the general sweep of the karnataka agricultural produce market regulation act 1966 point no 3 was framed in this connection which reads as under  whether the act as amended by act 17 of 1980 in so far it provides for regulation of marketing of sugarcane is unconstitutional as its marketing is regulated by the provisions of the central act viz the essential commodities act 1955 and the sugarcane control order made thereunder\n",
      "41 while answering point no3 in affirmative the learned judge at para 39 of the report made the following pertinent observations   it appears to us that the sugarcane control order regulates every aspect of marketing of sugarcane and its provisions are irreconcilable with the provisions relating to the marketing under the act for instance the place of delivery the price the manner of its payments are all fixed by the statutory order the same aspects of marketing are sought to be regulated by the act the two sets of provisions collide s6 of the essential commodities act gives overriding effect to the orders made under s3 of that act as against any other law the small portion of the sugarcane grown by the grower the sale of which is left regulated under the statutory order is again a matter  and part  of the policy of the regulation itself\n",
      "accordingly point no3 in that case was answered in affirmative apart from the question of repugnancy which strictly did not arise for their consideration the aforesaid reasoning of the learned judges of the karnataka high court clearly indicates that the entire field of regulation of purchase and sale of sugarcane in the market area is occupied by the sugarcane control order this reasoning was left untouched by this court in appeal against the said decision and therefore got confirmed in the case of itc ltd and others vs state of karnataka and others 1985 suppl scc 476 1985 indlaw sc 531\n",
      "42 learned senior counsel for the respondents was right when he contended in the aforesaid decision before this court that the merits of the reasoning which appealed to the high court were not gone into as the appeal arising from the judgment on this point was not pressed however the fact remains that the aforesaid reasoning of the karnataka high court remained untouched by this court nor was it dissented from the facts of the present case project even a stronger situation so far as the appellants are concerned whatever shortfall is found in the sugar control order has been supplemented by the sugarcane act by the bihar legislation itself reasoning which appealed to the karnataka high court in the above judgment rendered in absence of a separate complementary legislation by the karnataka legislature gets further strengthened in the light of the sugarcane act in the present case consequently on a conjoint reading of the sugarcane order as well as the sugarcane act an inevitable conclusion has to be reached that the regulation of sale and purchase of sugarcane in the entire market area for which the general act namely the market act is enacted is fully governed and highlighted by these two special provisions harmoniously operating in the very same field\n",
      "43 therefore there would remain no occasion for the state authorities to rationalise and reasonably visualise any need for regulating the purchase sale as well as storage of sugarcane in the market area concerned the wide sweep of general notification of s 3 of the market act therefore will have to be read down by excluding from its general sweep sugarcane and its products as the definition of agricultural produce as noted earlier would otherwise include not only primary produce of agriculture but also any other commodity processed or manufactured out of such primary agricultural produce that is precisely the reason why the state of bihar having realised the futility of the need about controlling and regulating the sale and purchase of sugarcane in the market area by the sugar factories excluded the operation of s 15 of the act which noted earlier is the soul of the act it is easy to visualise that if transactions concerning an agricultural produce are excluded from the operation of s 15 of the act the entire machinery available to the market committee to regulate such transactions would get out of picture and there would be no room for the market committee to supply any infrastructural facility or other benefits to the seller of such agricultural produce on the one hand and the purchaser thereof on the other before parting with the discussion on this point it is necessary to note one submission of learned senior counsel shri rakesh dwivedi for the respondents  state of bihar\n",
      "he submitted that the legal proposition regarding special act excluding the operation of general act can be invoked only when the general act irreconciliably derogates or conflicts with the special act while dealing with the same subject matter and cannot be harmonised he submitted that the broad objective of the two enactments is different the sugarcane act purports to regulate production supply and distribution of sugarcane whereas the market act lays emphasis on regulating the market the subject matters are closely allied but nevertheless distinct he placed reliance on two decisions of this court in support of his aforesaid contention in the case of jugal kishore vs state of maharashtra and others 1989 suppl 1 scc 589 1988 indlaw sc 235 this court was concerned with the question whether the provisions regarding ceiling on land as fixed by the maharashtra agricultural lands ceiling on holdings act 1961 could be reconciled and could harmoniously coexist with 1958 act in this connection sabyasachi mukharji j speaking for the court made the following pertinent observations \n",
      "44 unless the acts with the intention of implementing various socioeconomic plans are read in such complementary manner the operation of the different acts in the same filed would create contradiction and would become impossible it is therefore necessary to take a constructive attitude in interpreting provisions of these types and determine the main aim of the particular act in question for adjudication before the court the aforesaid observations cannot be of any assistance to learned senior counsel for the respondents as the schemes of the relevant acts to which we have made a detailed reference contraindicate the possibility of harmonious operation of the market act on the one hand and the sugarcane act and the sugar control order on the other shri dwivedi tried to get out of this situation by submitting that as there is already an exemption notification us 42 of the market act s 15 will not be applicable to such transactions and therefore it would remain governed by the provisions of the sugarcane order and the sugarcane act with respect as seen earlier it is an over simplification of the situation as a question arises whether two legislations operating in the same field can be reconciled or not a mere possibility of the provisions of one of the inconsistent enactments being excluded by resorting to exemption power under another enactment cannot cure the basic inconsistency between them it is obvious that such exemption power entrusted to its delegate by its legislature may or may not be utilised consequently a basic inconsistency between two legislative enactment would remain operative dehors such exemption if any such conflicting statutory schemes in their operation in the same field would directly collide it may be that the market act and the sugarcane act can both be treated as dealing with socioeconomic balancing of interests of growers of agricultural produce and the purchasers thereof but if it is impossible to reconcile them the statute laying down the general scheme of operation has to make room for a special statute for which a separate and exclusive field is carved out by the legislature itself\n",
      "45 reliance placed by shri dwivedi senior counsel for the state of bihar on a decision of the two judge bench of this court in the case of s satyapal reddy and others vs govt of ap and others 19944 scc 391 1994 indlaw sc 1568 for submitting that minimum qualifications prescribed by the rules framed under the central act could coexist with higher qualifications prescribed by the state rules also cannot be of real assistance to him for the simple reason that if minimum prices were fixed by the sugarcane control order and the sugarcane act had stopped short by providing only minimum price and had not regulated the fixation of even higher contractual price by providing for a machinery for the same and had not fixed and regulated the production control distribution sale and purchase of sugarcane it could have been urged by counsel for the respondents with some emphasis that both these statutory provisions could harmoniously coexist but as discussed earlier such a possibility is not only remote but incapable of visualisation it is also not possible to agree with the contention of learned senior counsel shri dwivedi that the sugarcane act of 1981 does not expressly purport to exclude the market act especially when the bihar legislature that had enacted the former act was aware of the market act 1960 holding the field that this circumstance shows that the legislature purposely did not exclude the applicability of the market act so far as the purchase and sale of sugarcane in market areas were concerned however this contention by itself cannot clinch the issue if the very same legislature had felt that existing general act was sufficient to foot the bill then there would have been remained no occasion for the very same legislature to enact a special act for control regulation sale and purchase of sugarcane after passage of 21 years therefore the latter act clearly envisaged carving out of a special field for regulating the sale and purchase of sugarcane and to that extent pro tanto it excluded the operation of the market act for that commodity the intention of the legislature is thus very clear on this aspect\n",
      "46 but apart from that intention of its delegatethe state of bihar itself is also clear when it excluded s 15 of the market act in exercise of its exemption power us 42 of the market act it is difficult to appreciate the contention of learned senior counsel that s 15 of the market act is not the core of the act on a conjoint reading of sections 3 4 15 27 and 30 of the act it has to be held that it is only because of the operation of s 15 covering the sale and purchase transactions of agricultural produce that the market committee can effectively discharge its functions entrusted to it by the act but for s 15 there would remain no occasion for the market committee to effectively regulate the sale and purchase transactions of the agricultural produce concerned s 15 mandates the sellers and producers of agricultural produce to operate in the notified market yard or submarket yards and only at these places the market committee through its officers and servants can discharge its functions effectively by regulating these transactions and for that purpose all the infrastructural facilities would be available the entire machinery provisions enacted for the purpose would fulcrum round the vibrant operation of s 15 once s 15 is excluded qua any agricultural produce the entire machinery of the market act would come to a grinding halt so far as such an excluded agricultural produce is concerned sugarcane is one such produce as we have already seen earlier\n",
      "47 consequently qua such a produce the general sweep of the market act will be a total nonstarter logically therefore there would remain no occasion for the market committee to justify levy of market fee us 27 of the act read with s 30 on these transactions on a conjoint reading of ss 27 and 30 of the market act it becomes clear that a market committee which has to effectively control and regulate the sale and purchase of agricultural produce brought for sale and purchase in the market area as enjoined by s 15 can effectively discharge its functions and spend its funds for supplying the necessary infrastructure for this purpose as laid down by s 30 at this stage we may also refer to an additional submission of the addl solicitor general of india shri rn trivedi in support of the respondents he submitted that entry 28 of list ii of the seventh schedule of the constitution operates on its own and cannot be affected by any legislation pertaining to industry as found in entry 52 of list i of seventh schedule of the constitution to that extent the learned senior counsel is right however as we have seen earlier entry 28 of list ii dealing with markets and fairs has to be read jointly with entries 26 and 27 dealing with trade and commerce and once the state legislation deals with these topics then it also squarely invokes legislative powers under entry 33 of list iii that is precisely the entry under which the sugarcane act 1981 can be said to have been enacted it is of course true that the union parliament has not exercised its concurrent legislative powers under entry 33 of list iii for regulating the sale and purchase of sugarcane but as noted earlier the sugarcane control order promulgated under the central legislation of the essential commodities act when read harmoniously and in conjunction with the state sugarcane act carves out a special field for their operation and by the sweep of their combined operation the general provisions of the market act pro tanto get excluded so far as the transactions of purchase and sale of sugarcane in the market area are concerned\n",
      "48 2 sale of sugar and molasses so far as the sale transactions pertaining to these commodities are concerned it has to be kept in view that they will have to be treated as agricultural produce in the light of the definition of s 21a of the market act they get manufactured from the basic agricultural produce namely the sugarcane however the question remains whether their sales are also controlled by the relevant special statutory provisions it will therefore be necessary for us to have a look at these relevant special statutory provisions in this connection our attention was invited to four orders framed us 3 of the essential commodities act pertaining to sugar  1 sugar control order 1966 2 sugar packing  marking order 1970 3 sugar restriction on movement order 1970 4 levy sugar supply control order 1979 cl 3 of the sugar control order 1966 deals with regulation and production of sugar which enables the central government to direct that no sugar can be manufactured from sugarcane except and in accordance with the conditions specified in a licence issued in this behalf cl 4 thereof deals with permissible directions to be issued by the central government to the effect that no producer shall sell or agree to sell or otherwise dispose of or deliver or agree to deliver any kind of sugar or remove any kind of sugar from the bonded godowns of the factory in which it is produced cl 5 enables the central government to issue directions to producers and dealers of sugar regarding the production maintenance of stock storage sale grading packing marking weighment disposal delivery and distribution of any kind of sugar cl 6 deals with the power of the central government to regulate movement of sugar cl 7 deals with the power to regulate quality of sugar cl 10 deals with the power of the central government to call for requisite information from different sources enacted therein cl 11 deals with the power of any officer authorised by the central government to inspection entry search sampling seizure etc as enacted therein the sugar packing and marking order 1970 provides statutory directions as to the quality of sugar to be packed in each bag the sugar restriction on movement order 1970 deals with restrictions on transport of certain types of sugar the levy sugar supply control order 1979 enables the central government to issue directions to any producer or recognised dealer to supply levy sugar of such type or grade to such persons or organisation as may be enacted in the order\n",
      "49 the aforesaid provisions of the various orders issued us 3 of the essential commodities act clearly indicate that all sale transactions of sugar by factories manufacturing sugar out of the sugarcane the basic agricultural produce and raw material are regulated by these provisions as noted earlier s 15 of the market act is out of picture qua even these transactions the sale of sugar manufactured out of sugarcane and fixation of price thereof would also therefore go out of the sweep of s 151  2 of the market act and would be governed wholly by these special provisions of the control orders on the parity of reasons governing the transactions of sale and purchase of sugarcane transactions of sale of sugar manufactured out of purchased sugarcane by the very same sugar factories functioning in the market area would also be governed by special provisions of the aforesaid special sugar control orders and would pro tanto get excluded from the general sweep of the market act in this connection we may also refer to the main contentions of shri rakesh dwivedi learned senior counsel for the state he submitted that the aforesaid various control orders regulating sugar have been issued with the objective of maintaining supply of sugar and ensuring availability of the same not only the object is different but in effect the control orders regulate production of sugar impose levy determine price of levy sugar provide for packing in bags in quantities of 100 kgs provide for transport under a permit issued by the central governmentstate government when sold under s 32f of essential commodities act 1955 levy sugar and specifications of dealer for supply of levy sugar\n",
      "50 as far as free sugar is concerned only monthly quotas are fixed thus as far as free sale sugar is concerned the central government does not fix the price and does not determine the person to whom it is to be sold or the manner in which it is to be transported the various provisions of the market act for regulating sale purchase and storage of free sugar would therefore be available and the capacity of market committee to regulate these transactions is not affected by these orders and to that extent there is no repugnancy between them and the market act it is not possible to agree with this submission for the simple reason that the provisions of sugar control orders have not to be read in isolation but will have to be read with the special provisions controlling the production sale and purchase of sugarcane out of which sugar is manufactured by the very same sugar factories functioning in the market area they are all integrated transactions and are subject to a well knit statutory scheme of control of these commodities it is obvious that regulation of sugarcane supply and distribution is not in isolation the main purpose of such regulation is for ensuring better quality and adequate quantity of sugar manufactured out of sugarcane supplied by sugarcane growers to earmarked sugar factories which manufacture sugar by crushing sugarcane in their factories by resorting to vacuum pan manufacturing process therefore it is the ultimate sale of the manufactured article namely sugar by way of levy sugar or in free market that is sought to be controlled by the control orders which cannot effectively operate save and except in harmony with the provisions enacted for the control of raw material namely the sugarcane as envisaged by the sugarcane orders as well as the sugarcane act they together therefore provide a complete machinery for controlling the production sale and purchase not only of the raw material  sugarcane but also finished product sugar and in this background we have to visualise the legislative intent underlying the enactment of the sugarcane act on the one hand and the exclusion of s 15 to such transactions by the delegate of the legislature namely the state of bihar on the other it is also necessary to visualise that once s 15 is out of the way for governing the sale and purchase transactions by sugar factories not only the purchase of sugarcane as raw material by them but also the sale of their finished product namely  sugar is also out of the sweep of s 15 of the market act consequently the entire regulatory machinery and the infrastructural facilities to be made available by the market committees for regulating the sale and purchase of such an agricultural produce would not give any signals and would get totally excluded sale of molasses  this takes us to the consideration of the statutory control of sale of molasses by sugar factories functioning in the market area it has to be kept in view that molasses is a byproduct of the sugar industry and the sale of molasses by the sugar factories is wholly controlled by the statutory provisions contained in the bihar molasses control act 1947 the preamble to the act reads as under an act to provide for the control of the distribution supply storage and price of molasses produced by factories in the state of bihar\n",
      "51 s 2c of the molasses act defines molasses as under  molasses means final residual byproduct of factories manufacturing sugar from cane or by refining gur by means of vacuum pans but does not include convertible molasses which are the final residual byproduct of sugar factories operating on the open pan system s 3 of the act provides as under  submission of returns by occupiers of factories and stockists every owner manager or occupier of a factory and every stockist shall furnish to the controller within the time and in the manner specified by the controller such returns relating to stocks of molasses as the controller may by order from time to time direct s 4 of the act provides that no molasses produced in the state nor any molasses held by the stockists in this state shall without the permission of the controller be moved by rail road or river from any place in the state to any other place therein\n",
      "52 as per s 5 of the act a sugar factory cannot even enter into an agreement or contract with any person other than the government or person licensed by the controller for supply of molasses all molasses have to be sold by sugar factories in accordance with the directions of the molasses controller issued us 6 of the molasses act the price of molasses is regulated by s 8 of the act section 8a provides that the state government may impose administrative charges on the sale of released molasses for meeting the cost of establishment for supervision and control over such release it is thus clear that the sale of molasses is also regulated by the state government and the cost of such regulation is recovered under the molasses act in the form of administrative charges section 8c requires every owner occupier and manager of sugar factory to place in a separate fund suitable amount for the purpose of construction and maintenance of adequate facilities for storage of molasses section 9c makes detailed provisions relating to storage of molasses and construction of storage tanks by the sugar factories s 11 gives overriding effect to the provisions of the molasses act over any provision contained in any other act s 13 which is the section conferring the power to make rules provides for the making of rules for carrying out the purposes of the act and empowers in particular\n",

      "ff prescribe the manner in which accounts of funds for regulation of adequate storage facilities in respect of molasses produced in factories shall be maintained and operated\n",
      "g any other matter which is required to be or which may be prescribed under this act\n",
      "53 the bihar molasses control rules 1955 contain detailed provisions in rule 3 relating to supply of molasses by sugar factories reference may be made to clause h of rule 3 which is in the following terms  every sugar factory and every stockist shall on receipt of an order from the controller and on intimation of the allotment of tank wagons for the transport of molasses make all necessary arrangements promptly for the haulage and loading of molasses and where the owner occupier or manager of a sugar factory or the stockist fails to make such arrangements without sufficient reason the excise officer shall have the power on his behalf to enter upon the premises make arrangement for the haulage and loading of molasses by manual labour if necessary recover the cost incurred thereby from the said owner occupier as manager of the sugar factory or the stockist\n",
      "rule 10 provides that no molasses can be moved from the premises of a sugar factory except under a pass in form mf6 rule 11 provides that molasses cannot be moved from the premises of any sugar factory except under a movement order in form mf7 issued by the controller as provided in the act and rules the aforesaid provisions leave no room for doubt that the sale and purchase of molasses which would be an agricultural produce as defined by s 21a of the market act being a byproduct resulting from manufacture of sugar by utilising the basic agricultural produce namely sugarcane are wholly controlled by the molasses control act enacted by the very same legislature which has enacted the market act it is easy to visualise that the very same legislature which enacted both these provisions was pressed to be alive to the need of having special provisions for regulating the sale and purchase of molasses and that by itself would exclude the need to get these transactions generally controlled and regulated by the sweep of the market act as per s 3 of the said act that is precisely the reason for even its delegate the state of bihar in its wisdom to exclude the applicability of s 15 of the market act so far as the sale transactions of molasses by the sugar factories operating in the market area are concerned the validity of the bihar molasses act 1947 has been upheld by this court in the case of siel ltd and others vs union of india and others 1998 7 scc 26 1998 indlaw sc 1288 it has been held to be traceable to entry 33 list iii and is having presidents assent\n",
      "54 it is therefore obvious that the molasses act laying down a detailed statutory scheme of control of sale and purchase of molasses produced by the sugar factories in the market area will remain within the statutory framework of the aforesaid special statute the general provisions of the market act has therefore to give way to the aforesaid special provisions it was next submitted by learned senior counsel for the state of bihar that even though the market committee may not be in a position to regulate sale purchase storage or processing of molasses not released by the controller atleast after they were decontrolled by the central government in june 1993 and even when the state governments have partially decontrolled transactions regarding molasses such transactions could be regulated under the market act this submission also cannot be countenanced the reason is obvious once the state of bihar itself has exempted these sale transactions from the operation of s 15 of the act they would be out of sweep of the general provisions of the market act and would not statutorily enjoin the market committees to provide any infrastructure for regulating sale of molasses to enable them to bring home the charge of market fee on the sale transactions of molasses as per s 27 of the act as a result of this discussion the first contention will have to be answered in negative by holding that the provisions of the market act cannot apply to the transactions of purchase of sugarcane and sale of sugar and molasses by the sugar mills situated and functioning within the market area of the concerned market committee constituted under the market act\n",
      "55 contention no 2  this takes us to the consideration of the alternative contention canvassed by learned senior counsel for the appellants in support of the appeals strictly speaking this alternative contention does not survive for our consideration in view of our answer to the first contention however as we have heard learned counsel for the parties on this alternative contention we may deal with the same on merits it has to be kept in view that market fee levied under the market act is a fee and not a tax the market act in so far as it enacts s 27 levying market fee is referable to entry 66 of the state list read with entry 47 of the concurrent list both of them deal with topics of legislation pertaining to fees in respect of the matters enumerated in the respective lists in the case of kewal krishan puri and anr vs state of punjab and anr etc etc 1980 1 scc 416 1979 indlaw sc 222 a constitution bench of this court while upholding the levy of market fee under the punjab agricultural produce markets act 1961 has made the following pertinent observations in paragraph 23 of the report untwalia j speaking for the court observed  from a conspectus of the various authorities of this court we deduce the following principles for satisfying the tests for a valid levy of market fees on the agricultural produce bought or sold by licensees in a notified market area \n",
      "1 that the amount of fee realised must be earmarked for rendering services to the licensees in the notified market area and a good and substantial portion of it must be shown to be expended for this purpose\n",
      "2 that the services rendered to the licensees must be in relation to the transaction of purchase or sale of the agricultural produce\n",
      "3 that while rendering services in the market area for the purposes of facilitating the transactions of purchase and sale with a view to achieve the objects of the marketing legislation it is not necessary to confer the whole of the benefit on the licensees but some special benefits must be conferred on them which have a direct close and reasonable correlation between the licensees and the transactions\n",
      "4 that while conferring some special benefits on the licensees it is permissible to render such service in the market which may be in the general interest of all concerned with the transactions taking place in the market\n",
      "5 that spending the amount of market fees for the purpose of augmenting the agricultural produce its facility of transport in villages and to provide other facilities meant mainly or exclusively for the benefit of the agriculturists is not permissible on the ground that such services in the long run go to increase the volume of transactions in the market ultimately benefiting the traders also such an indirect and remote benefit to the traders is in no sense a special benefit to them\n",
      "6 that the element of quid pro quo may not be possible or even necessary to be established with arithmetical exactitude but even broadly and reasonably it must be established by the authorities who charge the fees that the amount is being spent for rendering services to those on whom falls the burden of the fee\n",
      "7 at least a good and substantial portion of the amount collected on account of fees may be in the neighbourhood of twothirds or threefourths must be shown with reasonable certainty as being spent for rendering services of the kind mentioned above\n",
      "56 it becomes at once clear that before justifying levy of market fee on any transaction the services to be rendered by the market committee must be in connection with the sale and purchase transactions of agricultural produce falling for regulation under the market act when the purchase and sale of agricultural produce like sugarcane sugar or molasses are not governed by the market act as we have seen while considering contention no1 there would remain no occasion for the market committee to be statutorily under any obligation to provide any services or infrastructural facilities for covering such transactions so as to be entitled to charge market fee on such transactions it was vehemently contended by learned senior counsel for the respondents that various types of infrastructural facilities are being made available to sugar factories who are purchasing sugarcane in the market area and selling manufactured sugar and molasses in the very same market area the following are the various facilities and services highlighted in this connection \n",
      "1 link road facilities by which market committees were to spend monies for connecting villages in the market area with the main roads for facilitating the movement of agricultural produce including the sugarcane from the farms to the purchase centres of the factories\n",
      "2 spread of information regarding prices of agricultural produce for information of growers of sugarcane\n",
      "3 providing mediation facility to enable the growers of sugarcane to get higher price for sugarcane as compared to the minimum prices fixed under the control orders\n",
      "4 supervision of weighment of sugarcane\n",
      "5 licensing of weighing inspectors\n",
      "6 providing for drinking facility and park\n",
      "7 parking facilities at the purchase centres\n",
      "57 shri trivedi addlsolicitor general in his turn tried to highlight the concept of link roads being other than approach roads he submitted that near the factory gate or purchase centres provision of approach roads may be a statutory obligation of the sugar factories thus approach roads would connect the purchase centres with the nearby public roads but so far as link roads are concerned they are also public roads other than approach roads which connect villages with main roads and all these facilities make possible quicker movement of sugarcane from farms to the purchase centres this results in supplying better quality of sugarcane for being crushed in the factories so that before such sugarcane dries out it gets crushed resulting in better quality and larger quantity of sugar for the benefit of sugar factories strong reliance was placed in this connection on various provisions of s 30 of the market act and it was submitted by learned senior counsel for the respondents that all these benefits are being made available to sugar factories and there is no reason for them to oppose payment of small amounts of market fees after getting these benefits from the market committees the aforesaid contentions of learned senior counsel for the respondents for salvaging the situation for the market committees though appearing attractive at the first blush do not survive on a closer scrutiny the reason is obvious only because the sugarcane factories are located in the market area they can be said to be covered by the general sweep of s 27 of the market act as the agricultural produce namely sugarcane as well as sugar and molasses can be said to be bought and sold in the market area but by the fact only of sale and purchase of these commodities in the market area it cannot be said that such agricultural produce belongs to the category of agricultural produce which is covered by the general sweep of the act\n",
      "58 in order to attract the charge under section 27 the concerned agricultural produce on which the market fee is to be levied must be required to be bought and sold in the market area within the jurisdiction of the concerned market committee as per s 15 of the market act which enjoins that no agricultural produce specified in the notification under subs 1 of s 4 shall be bought or sold by any person within the market area other than the relevant principal market yard or submarket yards thus on a conjoint reading of ss 27 and 15 of the market act it must be held that before any charge of market fee can settle regarding any purchase and sale transactions concerning the agricultural produce such agricultural produce must have been required to be sold or purchased at the relevant principal market yard or submarket yards it is obvious that principal market yard or submarket yards would be situated within the market area but if any agricultural produce is exempted from the provisions of s 151 of the act as in the case of sugarcane sugar and molasses there would remain no occasion for transactions of sale and purchase of these commodities to be carried on only in the principal market yard or submarket yards and not elsewhere in any other part of market area it is only those agricultural produce which are required to be bought and sold in the relevant principal market yard or submarket yards situated within the market area that attract charge of s 27 of the act once this charge is attracted the further question whether it is backed by any quid pro quo would survive for consideration on the facts of the present case s 15 as a whole is out of picture for controlling purchase and sale of sugarcane sugar and molasses by sugar factories operating in the market area as we have seen earlier the charge of market fee as envisaged by s 27 would not get attracted at all for them hence the aforesaid list of the infrastructural facilities made available to sugar factories in general with other dealers in agricultural produce attracting s 15 of the act would pale into insignificance market committees would not supply adequate quid pro quo for levying market fee as the charge itself does not settle on these transactions by the sugar factories\n",
      "59 it may be as submitted by learned senior counsel for the respondents that some sugar factories may have taken benefit of electric lighting and preparation of approach roads by the market committees which might have spent sufficient funds for giving these facilities still they would not be a part and parcel of the statutory obligations of the market committees qua such sugar factories and may remain in the domain of s 72 of the indian contract act and if such benefits are received by the factories they may be liable on the principle of quantum meruit to reimburse or compensate the market committees for the voluntary facilities given by them but they would not support any legal quid pro quo by way of statutory obligation of the market committees for giving facilities to the sugar mills for supporting the levy of market fees on their transactions contention no2 is therefore answered in negative not on the ground that the services rendered by the market committee to the appellant sugar factories were not having any adequate quid pro quo but on the ground that they were not statutorily required to be made available to the sugar factories by way of statutory obligation of the market committee to regulate the sale and purchase transactions of sugarcane sugar and molasses by these sugar factories and also on the ground that the charge us 27 by levying market fee on the aforesaid transactions was not attracted at all on the facts and circumstances of the case as seen earlier as a result of our conclusion on the findings of the aforesaid two contentions the appeals and other writ petition in sugar group matters will be required to be allowed and the impugned judgment of the high court in all these matters will have to be set aside however the further question that survives is as to what relief can be given to the appellants and the writ petitioners in this sugar group of matters it is obvious that during the pendency of these proceedings no interim relief was given to the appellants and the writ petitioners therefore they must have paid the market fee on the concerned transaction all these years in the common course of events they would have passed on the burden of market fee on purchasers and the ultimate consumers of sugar and molasses produced by the sugar factories by utilising sugarcane as raw material shri shanti bhushan learned senior counsel for the appellants in this connection submitted that accepting the principle of unjust enrichment we may reserve liberty to the appellants to show before the authorities whether they have in fact passed on the burden of impugned market fee at the relevant time and if they could show to the satisfaction of the authorities that in fact they have not passed on the burden then they may be treated to be entitled to get refund of all the appropriate amounts of market fee not passed on\n",
      "60 in our view it is not possible to accept this contention as years have rolled by since the impugned market fees have been levied by the different market committees in the state of bihar in the normal course of events no prudent businessmanmanufacturer would ever bear the burden of such compulsory fee or tax to be paid from his own pocket even otherwise reserving such liberty would create unnecessary complication and may give rise to spate of avoidable litigations in the hierarchy of proceedings under these circumstances keeping in view the peculiar facts and circumstances of these cases we deem it fit to direct in exercise our powers uart 142 of the constitution of india that the present decision will have only prospective effect meaning thereby that after the pronouncement of this judgment all future transactions of purchase of sugarcane by the sugar factories concerned in the market areas as well as the sale of manufactured sugar and molasses produced therefrom by utilising this purchased sugarcane by these factories will not be subjected to the levy of market fee us 27 of the market act by the market committees concerned all past transactions upto the date of this judgment which have suffered the levy of market fee will not be covered by this judgment and the collected market fees on these past transactions prior to the date of this judgement will not be required to be refunded to any of the sugar mills which might have paid these market fees\n",
      "61 however one rider has to be added to this direction if any of the market committees has been restrained from recovering market fee from the writ petitioners in the high court or if any of the writ petitioners in the high court has as an appellant before this court obtained stay of the payment of market fee then for the period during which such stay has operated and consequently market fee was not paid on the transactions covered by such stay orders there will remain no occasion for the market committee concerned to recover such market fee from the concerned sugar mill after the date of this judgment even for such past transactions in other words market fees paid in past shall not be refunded similarly market fees not collected in past also shall not be collected hereafter the impugned judgments of the high court in this group of sugar matters will stand set aside as aforesaid the writ petition directly filed before this court also will be required to be allowed in aforesaid terms before parting with this group of matters it must be clarified that the present judgment will be applicable in connection with the purchase of sugarcane by the sugar factories as well as the sale of manufactured sugar and molasses by these factories functioning in the areas of market committees concerned and whose transactions are governed by the provisions of the sugarcane control order 1966 as well as the sugarcane act of 1981 and also by the relevant provisions of the sugar orders and the provisions of molasses control act any other transactions of purchase and sale in principal market yard or submarket yards of sugarcane sugar or molasses by any other licensed dealers not governed by the aforesaid provisions will not be covered by the ratio of this judgment\n",
      "62 wheat products  atta maida suzi bran etc in this group of matters six flour mills functioning in market areas within the jurisdiction of market committees concerned have brought in challenge the applicability of the market act to the transactions of purchase of wheat by these mills and manufacture out of the same different wheat products like atta maida suzi bran etc the high court of judicature at patna repelled their contentions against the applicability of the market act on grant of special leave to appeal they are before us in these proceedings shri ranjit kumar learned counsel appearing for the appellants raised two contentions for our consideration 1 under the industries development and regulation act 1951 for short idr act in public interest the union of india has taken over the control of the wheat industry as specified in the first schedule to the act and consequently any transaction of purchase and sale of the products of that industry cannot be regulated by the state act like the market act as a part of the very same contention it was submitted that wheat rolling flour mills licensing and control order 1957 and the bihar trading articles licenses unification order 1984 issued us 3 of the essential commodities act 1955 lay down a complete scheme for regulating purchase and sale of wheat products and hence these transactions cannot be covered by the general sweep of the market act 2 alternatively it was contended that wheat may be an agricultural produce but sale of atta maida suzi cannot be treated as agricultural produce we shall deal with the aforesaid contentions point wise point no1 it is true that the union parliament in exercise of its legislative power under entry 52 of list i of the seventh schedule has enacted the idr act\n",
      "63 it is also true that flour industry is listed as one of the scheduled industries as item no274 under the caption food processing industries however production of wheat as raw material or its sale is not covered by the said act consequently so far as wheat as agricultural produce is concerned it is outside the sweep of the idr act however when flour industry is covered by the said act question remains whether sale of flour or any other products out of wheat can be said to be covered by the sweep of the idr act regulation of sale and purchase of flour as a controlled industry was sought to be emphasised by shri ranjit kumar by inviting our attention to section 18g of the idr act section 18g subs 1 reads as follows  18g power to control supply distribution price etc of certain articles  1 the central government so far as it appears to it to be necessary or expedient for securing the equitable distribution and availability at fair prices of any article or class of articles relatable to any scheduled industry may notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of this act by notified order provide for regulating the supply and distribution thereof and trade and commerce therein\n",
      "it is obvious that unless the central government in exercise of its statutory power under section 18g promulgates any statutory order covering this field it cannot be said that mere existence of a statutory provision for entrustment of such power by itself would result into regulation of purchase and sale of flour even if it is a scheduled industry shri ranjit kumar fairly stated that no such order has been promulgated by the central government for regulating the purchase and sale of flour in the market area according to him however the mere existence of such a statutory provision in the act enabling the central government to issue such orders would be sufficient to occupy the filed contemplated by this provision in support of this contention he invited our attention to a decision of this court in the case of the hingirrampur coal co ltd and others vs the state of orissa and others 1961 2 scr 537 1960 indlaw sc 452 at page 558 of the report gajendragadkar j speaking for the court made the following pertinent observations  \n",
      "64 entry 54 in list i dealing with regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the union is declared by parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest the effect of reading the two entries together is clear the jurisdiction of the state legislature under entry 23 is subject to the limitation imposed by the latter part of the said entry if parliament by its law has declared that regulation and development of mines should in public interest be under the control of the union to the extent of such declaration the jurisdiction of the state legislature is excluded it was contended by shri ranjit kumar relying on these observations that mere declaration under the idr act is enough to exclude the jurisdiction of the state legislature in connection with such a declared industry it is difficult to appreciate this contention it has to be kept in view that any legislation in exercise of legislative power under entry 54 of list i would enable the parliament to regulate mines and mineral development by taking them under the control of the union in public interest thus all aspects of mining industry would be covered by the general sweep of such a declaration however so far as the idr act is concerned it is enacted under entry 52 of the first schedule which deals with industries in general simultaneously in the state list itself there is entry 24 which deals with industries subject to the provisions of entries 7 and 52 of list i consequently the products of such controlled industries would necessarily not be governed by the sweep of the general legislation pertaining to such industries as per entry 52 of the union list the aforesaid constitution bench judgment was not concerned with any state legislation enacted under entry 24 on the contrary it dealt with legislation of the union parliament under entry 54 of the union list read with entry 23 of the state list the scheme of the aforesaid legislative entries is entirely different from the scheme of entry 52 of list i read with entry 24 of list ii with which we are concerned on a conjoint reading of the aforesaid two entries therefore the ratio of the decision of the constitution bench in the aforesaid case cannot be effectively pressed in service by shri ranjit kumar for supporting his contention\n",
      "65 in this connection we may usefully refer to a decision of this court in siel ltd and others 1998 indlaw sc 1288 supra wherein one of us sujata v manohar j was a member it has rightly distinguished the ratio of the constitution bench decision in the case of the hingirrampur coal co ltd and others 1960 indlaw sc 452 supra and taken the view that merely because an industry is controlled by a declaration us 2 of the idr act enacted by entry 52 of the union list the state legislature would not be denied of its powers to regulate the products of such an industry by exercise of its legislative powers under entry 24 of the state list in that case the question was whether up sheera niyantran adhiniyam 1964 could be said to be repugnant to the molasses control order issued by the central government under section 18g of the idr act imposing restrictions on the sale of molasses and fixing the maximum price of molasses answering the question in negative it was held that the term industry in entry 24 would not take within its ambit trade and commerce or production supply and distribution of goods which are within the province of entries 26 and 27 of list ii similarly entry 52 in list i which deals with industry also would not cover trade and commerce in or production supply and distribution of the products of those industries which fall under entry 52 of list i for the industries falling in entry 52 of list i these subjects are carved out and expressly put in entry 33 of list iii\n",
      "66 it was also held that since the molasses control order of 1961 passed by the central government in exercise of powers conferred by section 18g was not extended at any point of time to the state of up or the state of bihar the question of repugnancy between the molasses control order 1961 and the up sheera niyantran adhiniyam 1964 does not arise consequently it must be held that in the absence of statutory order promulgated under section 18g of the idr act it cannot be said that the field for regulation of sale and purchase of products of flour industry like atta maida suzi bran etc would remain outside the domain of the state legislature shri ranjit kumar then placed reliance on the statutory orders framed us 3 of the essential commodities act 1955 so far as the wheat rolling flour mills licensing and control order 1957 is concerned reliance was placed by him on cls 2 and 10 of the definition clause these clauses clearly indicated that the said order was not concerned with agriculturists nor was the order concerned with the pricing purchase and sale of wheat or wheat products consequently the said order cannot be said to have occupied the field so far as these topics are concerned he then invited our attention to the bihar trading articles licenses unification order 1984 cls 2 c g h and j as well as cls 15 and 18 on which reliance was placed were found not to be of any assistance to him for the simple reason that under that order dealers of foodgrains like wheat had to be licensed and their activities had to be supervised this order had also nothing to do with fixation of prices and regulating the purchase and sale of wheat and wheat products consequently the first contention canvassed by shri ranjit kumar cannot be sustained and is accordingly rejected\n",
      "67 point no 2 so far as the alternative contention is concerned he submitted that even though wheat is an agricultural produce atta maida suzi manufactured out of the same cannot be said to be agricultural produce as it is a produce of the factory and not of an agriculturist this contention of shri ranjit kumar also cannot be sustained for the simple reason that agricultural produce as defined by s 21 as already noted earlier would include all agricultural produce whether processed nonprocessed or manufactured out of any primary agricultural produce wheat is a produce of agriculture therefore any product resulting after processing such basic raw material or which results after process of manufacture is carried on qua such basic raw material would remain agricultural produce shri ranjit kumar fairly stated that he has not challenged the vires of s 2 1a but in his submission items 14 to 16 as found in the schedule to the act under the caption cereals are wrongly included as agricultural produce as they are not produce of agriculture moment the artificial definition of agricultural produce as aforesaid holds the field as a logical corollary these three disputed items would squarely get covered by the sweep of the term agricultural produce and hence their inclusion in the schedule enacted under s 21a as types of cereals cannot be found fault with these were the only contentions canvassed by shri ranjit kumar in support of his appeals as they fail the inevitable result is that all the civil appeals would be liable to be dismissed\n",
      "68 vegetable oils  civil appeal no1427 of 1979 moved by ms rohtas industries ltd which is now under liquidation represented through its liquidator raises similar contention as canvassed by shri ranjit kumar in support of the appeals moved by flour mills all vegetable oils are treated to be agricultural produce as per serial no4 of the schedule framed under s 21a of the market act in view of the general sweep of the said definition oil manufactured by the oil mills functioning within the areas of the market committees concerned by crushing oilseeds which are undisputedly agricultural produce and subjecting them to manufacturing process cannot be said to be outside the sweep of the regulatory provisions of the market act reliance placed in support of this appeal on the vegetable oil products control order 1947 the pulses edible oilseeds and edible oils storage control order 1977 the vegetable oil product producers regulation of refined oil manufacture order 1973 all framed us 3 of the essential commodities act 1955 also cannot be of any avail to the appellant industries for the simple reason that none of these orders deals with the topic of regulation of prices and sale and purchase of vegetable oil products consequently the field is wide open for the legislation of the state namely the market act for its applicability to the transactions of sale and purchase of vegetable oil products in the market areas concerned this civil appeal therefore also is liable to fail falling in line with the appeals concerning wheat and wheat products civil appeal nos 450005 of 1992 and civil appeal arising out of slp c no9684 of 1992 raise similar contentions in connection with vegetable edible oils on the very same reasoning as aforesaid these appeals are liable to fail\n",
      "69 rice milling industries the appeals arising from slp civil nos315960 of 1994 are moved by rice milling industries operating in the market area of the concerned market committees learned senior counsel for the appellant mills challenged notices issued to them by the agricultural produce market committees concerned requiring them to shift their trade to principal market yards it was contended that on account of the rice milling industry regulation act 1958 which is a central act the field for regulation of purchase and sale of products of rice milling industries would be fully occupied by the central act and if the state act like the market act seeks to encroach upon the said field it would become repugnant to the central act a close look at the relevant provisions of the said act shows that it does not seek to cover the aforesaid field subs 1 of s 6 of the said act reads as follows any owner of an existing rice mill or of a rice mill in respect of which a permit has been granted us 5 may make an application to the licensing officer for the grant of a licence for carrying on ricemilling operation in that rice mill s 8 deals with restrictions statutorily imposed on rice mills s 9 empowers the licensing officer or any person authorised by the central government to inspect the working of the rice mill the aforesaid relevant provisions of the act leaves no room for doubt that the working of the rice milling industries was sought to be regulated by the said act and it has nothing to do with the regulation of purchase and sale of products of such mills\n",
      "it was then submitted that the appellant rice mills import paddy from other state territories which are outside the notified market area falling under the market act and such imported paddy is processed and after manufacturing activities qua them rice is manufactured hence such activity cannot be governed by the market act it is obvious that if the appellant rice mills import paddy already purchased from outside the market area then on such transactions of outside purchase and import of paddy in the market area there would remain no occasion for the market committees concerned to subject such transactions to the regulating machinery of the market act or to demand any market fee thereof this was fairly conceded by learned senior counsel for the respondents he however added that if these rice milling industries located and functioning in the market area purchase within the market area raw material paddy whether grown in the market area concerned or outside then such purchases within the market area will attract the regulatory provisions of the market act there cannot be any dispute on this aspect as paddy obviously is an agricultural produce being item no1 in the category of cereals as found in schedule to the act\n",
      "70 so far as the manufactured rice out of such paddy is concerned once manufacturing takes place within the market area it would get squarely covered by the wide sweep of definition of s 21a as we have seen earlier even apart from that rice is mentioned as a separate item no2 in the category of cereals in the schedule of the market act it cannot be disputed that rice manufactured out of basic agricultural produce paddy would also remain agricultural produce falling within the sweep of the act so far as the regulation of sale and purchase of rice within the market area is concerned s 15 of the act applies to the transactions of licensed dealers dealing with such agricultural produce in the market area hence the entire machinery of the market act will be applicable to regulate transactions of sale and purchase of paddy by the rice mills within the market area as well as sale of rice by them within that area as all these transactions will have to take place in the market yard or submarket yards as per s 15 of the act however one grievance voiced by learned senior counsel for the appellants deserved to be noted before parting with the discussion in these appeals he submitted that there is no power and authority in the market committee to insist that the location of the rice milling industries also should be changed and must be shifted to the market yard in this connection our attention was invited to the notice  as a specimen notice in the said notice addressed to janta rice  flour mills issued by the advocate acting on behalf of the secretary agricultural produce market committee chakulia in the last but one paragraph the addressee was requested to shift the establishment of business in the main market yard at dighi of the agricultural produce market committee chakulia within 7 days it was submitted that this part of the direction is totally without jurisdiction as no market committee can compel the shifting of the business premises of the rice milling industries to any particular market yard as s 15 of the act only requires the sale and purchase transactions regarding the agricultural produce to be carried on in the market yard or submarket yards to that extent learned senior counsel for the appellant is right\n",
      "71 the statutory mandate of s 15 does not go beyond the regulation of transactions regarding purchase and sale of agricultural produce and that can be required to be effected only at the relevant principal market yard or submarket yard or yards none of the provisions of the market act would entitle the market committee to insist on shifting of the business premises of any milling company or factory processing agricultural produce located within the market area to any particular market yard or submarket yards learned senior counsel for the respondents shri dwivedi fairly conceded that the aforesaid direction contained in the impugned notice as worded is not correct and can be read down to mean only the shifting of the sale and purchase transactions concerning paddy and rice to the relevant market yard or submarket yards these directions are accordingly read down the said notice when so read down would remain well sustained in other words the appellants will not be required to shift the location of the rice mills to principal market yard or submarket yards if otherwise they are not already so located but are functioning at any place within the market area however their sale and purchase transactions of paddy and rice will of course be required to be carried on only in market yard or submarket yards concerned as mandated by s 15 of the market act subject to these clarifications and modifications in the directions contained in the impugned notice these appeals are liable to fail\n",

      "the latter branch is since closed both these branches fall within the jurisdiction of the agricultural produce market committees at patna and muzaffarpur according to the appellant though its activities were not covered by the sweep of the market act it was required to obtain licences under the act for operating at both these places in the market areas the appellant contended in the writ petition before the high court that the direction of the marketing authorities requiring the appellant to take licences under the market act was clearly ultra vires and illegal for the simple reason that the products sold by it within the market area were not agricultural produce at all therefore they were not governed by the sweep of the act the high court in the impugned judgment negated this contention and held that both these articles sold in packed tins were in substance milk products and therefore agricultural produce as defined by s 21a\n",
      "73 learned counsel appearing for the appellant vehemently submitted that before the aforesaid two products can be subjected to the regulatory procedure of the market act it must be shown by the respondents that they are agricultural produce he invited our attention to s 3 of the act and submitted that the very first step of the applicability of the act is the declaration of intention by the state government for regulating the purchase sale storage and processing of agricultural produce as mentioned in the notification that the said term agricultural produce as defined by s 21a clearly indicates that the agricultural produce which is to be covered by the sweep of the act has to be one which should be specified in the schedule when we turn to the schedule of the act framed as per s 21a we find one of the animal husbandry products at item viii subitem 20 as milk except liquid milk thus any product consisting of solidified milk like milk powder is contemplated by the said item it was submitted that in the entire schedule no where we find any mention of baby food which may be a substitute for milk or solidified milk it was therefore contended that the appellant which manufactures and sells special infant foods like lactodex and raptakos cannot be required to take any licence under the market act refuting this contention learned senior counsel for the respondents submitted that as noted by the high court the aforesaid two products manufactured and sold by the appellant do contain as base material milk in solidified form he invited our attention to the details submitted by the appellant before the high court and as noted by the high court in its judgment in connection with the ingredients and constituents of these two products\n",

      "74 placing reliance on these ingredients it was submitted that per 100 milligrams of lactodex milk fat content is 09 gms and that other minerals and vitamins may also include milk powder similarly raptakos special infant food also contains proteins and fats he also contended that even milk which is a complete food may contain vitamins therefore it cannot be said that these two products are not milk products or products containing some ingredients of milk it is difficult to accept this contention for the simple reason that the aforesaid schedule at subitem no20 captioned under the title animal husbandry products refers to milk except liquid milk by no stretch of imagination tinned baby food containing various ingredients which may include some milk fats or proteins though in powder form can be said to be milk powder simpliciter or whole milk not in liquid form it is also pertinent to note that there is no item of milk products in the schedule to the act under the caption animal husbandry products\n",
      "in this connection it is profitable to contradistinguish this entry in the schedule with items 1415 and 16 under the caption cereals in the very same schedule in the listed items under the caption cereals we find wheat separately mentioned at item no3 as compared to wheat atta suzi and maida separately mentioned at items 1415 and 16 this shows that basic agricultural produce  wheat is treated as a separate agricultural produce as compared to its own products manufactured out of wheat namely atta suzi and maida those products of the concerned basic agricultural produce are separately mentioned as agricultural produce in the schedule so far as cereals are concerned but similar is not the scheme in connection with milk milk products like baby foods are not separately mentioned under the very caption animal husbandry products butter and ghee are separately mentioned as items 7  8 which are wholly manufactured out of milk it therefore becomes clear that save and except butter and ghee no other milk product is sought to be covered by the sweep of the act as animal husbandry products and the basic animal husbandry produce like milk only in solid form is sought to be covered by a separate solitary item no20 as one of the animal husbandry products\n",

      "76 tea matters in the appeal filed by ms lipton tea india ltd the appellant company has brought in challenge the order of the high court of judicature at patna in writ petition no1027 of 1977 which was disposed of along with other cognate matters by a common judgment the appellant had contended before the high court that the market act cannot apply to the transaction of manufactured blended tea sold in packed tins and packets by it in the state of bihar consisting of areas of different market committees according to the appellant the object of the market act was to provide for better regulation of buying and selling of agricultural produce it was for the benefit of the agriculturists by providing them a market assuring a reasonable price of their products and also eliminating unhealthy competition and loss due to malpractices prevailing in the market that the appellant was neither an agriculturist nor did it purchase any article from any agriculturist in the bihar state that it purchased tea in auction under the tea act held at various notified centres in other states outside the bihar territory that the purchased tea was blended at appellants factories which were also situated outside bihar only after the purchased tea had undergone manufacturing process in appellants tea factories after blending and preparation of appropriate final product packed in tins and other receptacles this marketable commodity tea consisting of red label green label tea etc was being brought for sale within the territories of the state of bihar\n",
      "hence there was no occasion for the market committees to regulate the sale and purchase of such tea by the appellant manufactured outside the state of bihar it was also contended that the tea act which is the central act fully occupied the field of regulation of sale of such tea by the appellant in view of the special machinery provided under the tea act the general sweep of the market act could not be made applicable to the appellants sale transactions of manufactured tea within the state of bihar it was lastly contended that when the appellant was selling its manufactured tea in packed condition in the market area through its stockists no benefits of infrastructural facilities were required to be furnished by the market committee concerned and therefore insistence on the part of the market committee that the appellants stockists should sell packed tea only in the market yard or submarket yards was totally unauthorised and in fact amounted to imposition of sales tax on the sale transactions of tea and could not remain in the realm of genuine market fee these contentions were repelled by the high court and it was also held that any manufactured product out of the basic agricultural produce namely tea leaves would be covered by the act and as the manufactured items in packed conditions out of the basic agricultural produce  tea were being sold in the market area the machinery of the act was applicable to cover these transactions\n",
      "77 accordingly the writ petition was dismissed hence this appeal by special leave the learned senior counsel for the appellant shri shanti bhushan vehemently submitted that the very purpose of the market act is not to regulate the sale of tea manufactured by big tea manufacturing companies like the appellant whose factories are situated outside the state of bihar they purchase tea leaves in auction under the tea act held at different centres outside the state of bihar and manufacture after proper blending tea by packing it in suitable packings having labels showing different qualities of tea like green label tea red label tea etc that because the appellant imports manufactured tea only for the purpose of sale in bihar markets it cannot be said that the machinery of the market act which is essentially meant to regulate the sale and purchase of agricultural produce gets attracted that the market act is in substance meant to cover agricultural produce which are first grown in the market area and then sold within the same area it was also contended that tea was not one of the scheduled items earlier covered by the act enacted as early as in 1960 that only after 16 years in 1976 tea was added as one of the items in the schedule to the act under the caption miscellaneous item no xii as sub item 30 being tea leaf and dust it was submitted that this addition to the schedule was made by the state of bihar in exercise of its power under s 39 of the act which confers power on the state government by notification to add any of the items to be treated as agricultural produce for being specified in the schedule that this addition was made after the basic notification us 3 of the act was issued declaring the intention of the state to regulate the purchase sale storage and process of agricultural produce in such areas as may be specified in the notification this basic notification which was followed by the procedure of inviting objections and suggestions had culminated into declaration of market area us 4\n",
      "that initially as the item of tea was not in the schedule it was obviously not sought to be subjected to the regulation under the act consequently its purchase sale storage and process were obviously not intended to be covered by the act but when tea was added as an item in the schedule in 1976 the procedure contemplated by s 3 was obviously not undergone and no objections were invited s 4 a of the act which was inserted by way of clarification in 1993 also made it clear that the provisions of ss 3 and 4 shall not apply to the exercise of power by the state government under s 39 to amend the schedule by addition of any item of agricultural produce not specified therein in the light of the aforesaid statutory scheme it was vehemently submitted by shri shanti bhushan learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant that this insertion of tea as an added item in the schedule was exfacie unauthorised and a result of total nonapplication of mind on the part of the state and it is this exercise under s 39 of the act by the state authorities that was challenged in the writ petition in support of this challenge shri shanti bhushan pressed in service the following three contentions \n",
      "78 contention no1 the very scheme and purpose underlying the enactment of the market act shows that only those agricultural produce which are grown within the market area and whose sale in the first instance is to be regulated and also the subsequent sale of any manufactured item out of such basic agricultural produce raw material taking place within the market area are required to be regulated by the act so that illiterate and ignorant agriculturists who would otherwise suffer at the hands of middlemen and may not get adequate price for their product and due compensation for the toil undertaken by them in producing these agricultural commodities may get adequate return for their products the benevolent provisions of the regulatory scheme of the act are essential to protect the agriculturists from exploitation of middlemen in this connection our attention was drawn to the salient observations highlighting the basic purpose for enactment of such market acts as laid down by the constitution bench of this court in mcvs arunachala nadar case supra shri shanti bhushan submitted that the large scale manufacturers like lipton tea india ltd who manufacture tea outside the state in their sophisticated factories having latest machinery are not illiterate agriculturist producers of agriculture goods and commodities in their fields and do not require protection under the act that as these salient features of the act are not kept in view by the state authorities while inserting entry of tea in the schedule the said act on the part of the state authorities was clearly ultra vires and incompetent\n",
      "contention no 2 in any case as the purchase and sale of tea were governed by the comprehensive provisions of the central act namely the tea act 1953 the said act would wholly govern transactions of purchase and sale of tea by the appellant and to that extent the market act would stand superseded or at least the statutory intention of regulating the purchase sale storage and processing of tea as per the provisions of s 3 of the market act would stand completely negated hence on that ground also the insertion of this item in the schedule would remain unauthorised and consequently the insistence on the part of the authorities that the sale transactions should be carried on only within the market yard or submarket yard was clearly illegal and violative of art 19 of the constitution of india\n",
      "79 contention no 3 it was lastly contended by shri shanti bhushan that no quid pro quo existed between the demand for market fee by the market committees and the sale transactions effected by appellants selling agents so far as tea in packed tins was concerned no infrastructural facilities were available for or required to be supplied to the sellers of such tea learned senior counsel for the respondents on the other hand tried to salvage the situation by submitting that even though the tea act may control the sale and purchase of tea which is a highly monopolistic and export earning commodity once the blended tea in deliverable state duly packed in tins and other packages by the appellant tea company enters the bihar markets for sale it cannot be said that the sale of this commodity cannot be treated to be sale of agricultural produce by the appellant within the market area in the state of bihar as agricultural produce defined by s 21a would cover not only the purchase and sale of agricultural produce in its raw form but also in its processed and manufactured form as per the wide sweep of the said definition he submitted that it cannot be disputed that tea in its raw form is an agricultural produce because tea leaves are grown in tea gardens and then they are plucked and processed in tea factories and after blending the manufactured tea in deliverable state becomes available to be sold in wholesale markets and then in the retail markets that even though the appellants factory manufacturing the blended tea may be outside the state of bihar the moment the blended tea in packed form is sold in the state of bihar in the market areas concerned it cannot be said that the provisions of the market act would not apply to such sale transactions on a conjoint reading of s 21a and the schedule under miscellaneous item xii subitem 30 therefore it has to be held that the market act would squarely get attracted to regulate the sale of such produce of tea by the appellant in the bihar markets so far as the tea act is concerned it is submitted that it only regulates the sale of plucked tea from the tea gardens and provides machinery for sale by auction of such tea at the relevant centres and even in such auction when the appellant purchases these roasted tea leaves it cannot be said that the tea act would cover any further transactions of manufactured tea out of the purchased tea leaves by auction purchasers like the appellant at its factories situated outside the bihar state that auction purchased tea leaves are processed by the appellant and blending work is done thereafter\n",
      "80 that what is relevant for the applicability of the market act is the fact that this manufactured tea packed in suitable packets and tins is brought for sale within the market area in the bihar state and these are the transactions of sale of manufactured tea out of the basic agricultural produce tea leaves that would attract the sweep of the market act notwithstanding the provisions of the tea act that once the market act applies to such sale transactions the entire infrastructural facilities would be available to the appellant as these sales have to take place in the market yard or submarket yards as required by s 15 of the act once the appellant gets the benefit of this infrastructure it cannot be said that no sufficient quid pro quo is made available under the act by the market committees concerned to justify them to levy the market fee from the buyers of tea that so far as the appellant is concerned there is no burden of paying market fee as a seller of manufactured tea the burden will be borne by the buyers who are not making any grievance in this connection in the light of the aforesaid contentions the following points arise for our consideration 1 whether the basic agricultural produce ie tea leaves which is subjected to manufacturing process outside the bihar state and is imported and sold in manufactured condition as packed tea within the bihar state in the market areas concerned attracts the provisions of the market act for regulating such transactions of sale 2 whether the tea act of 1953 and the relevant orders promulgated thereunder fully occupy the field regarding regulation of purchase and sale of tea and consequently the market act being a general act would get excluded for regulating the transactions of sale of manufactured tea in bihar state and 3\n",
      "81 whether there is adequate quid pro quo supporting the levy of market fee on such transactions of sale of manufactured and packed blended tea in markets governed by the market act we will now deal with the aforesaid three points in the same sequence in which they were pressed for consideration point no1 at first blush learned senior counsel for the appellant shri shanti bhushan appeared to be on a firm footing when he submitted that the legislative intention underlying the enactment of the market act was to protect illiterate and unwary agriculturist from middlemen so that he may not be exploited by them and may get appropriate price for his basic agricultural produce but on a closer scrutiny the said contention does not appear to be well sustained s 21a of the market act as seen earlier includes in the definition of agricultural produce not only the primary produce grown in the field but also covers all processed or nonprocessed manufactured or nonmanufactured agricultural produce as specified in the schedule in the light of the aforesaid wide sweep of this definition it cannot be said that tea leaves which are produced in tea gardens being primary agricultural produce would cease to be agricultural produce once they got processed after plucked tea leaves are processed by roasting them and then by subjecting them to further process of blending and ultimately packing them in suitable packets they still remain all the same agricultural produce so manufactured out of the basic agricultural raw material tea leaves it is also not in dispute that tea leaf and dust is a scheduled item once that is so sale of manufactured tea in packed condition within the market area would squarely attract the charge us 27 of the act which as noted earlier is widely worded the moment the agricultural produce as defined by s 21a is bought or sold in the market area s 27 would get attracted to cover such transaction\n",
      "82 it is also pertinent to note that s 15 subs 1 of the act is applicable in the present case to cover such transactions of sale of packed tea within the market areas of the concerned market committees governed by the act save and except such quantity as may be prescribed for retail sale or personal consumption to be outside the sweep of s 151 of the act rest of these sale transactions regarding manufactured agricultural produce would remain governed by the sweep of the act on a conjoint reading of s 21a and s 15 and the relevant entry in the schedule there is no escape from the conclusion that whether the manufactured agricultural produce has undergone manufacturing process within the market area or not or whether such agricultural produce in its raw form is grown in the market area or outside or whether the processed agricultural produce is imported only for sale within the market area the applicability of the act cannot be said to be ruled out to cover all these types of sale transactions the question posed by shri shanti bhushan learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant for our consideration is no longer res integra a constitution bench of this court in the case of ram chandra kailash kumar and company and others vs state of up and another etc etc 1980 suppl scc 27 1980 indlaw sc 131 speaking through untwalia j had to consider the question of imposition of market fee under the uttar pradesh krishi utpadan mandi adhiniyam 1964 on transactions of purchase and sale of agricultural produce in the market area while considering this question various contentions raised by traders operating in the agricultural market in up were listed in para 9 of the report contentions no9 and 23 listed in para 9 of the report are relevant for our purpose contention no9 reads as under  no market fee could be levied on goods not produced within the limits of a particular market area and if produced outside and brought in such area\n",
      "83 contention no23 reads as under  fee can be charged only on those transactions in which the seller is producer and not on any other transaction\n",
      "repelling these contentions the constitution bench held that market fee could be levied on transactions of sale of goods even though such goods are produced outside the state of uttar pradesh or outside the market area of that particular market committee provided the transactions of sale take place within the limits of that market area it was also held that on the other hand there was no provision in the act or the rules to limit the operation of the law in a particular market area only in respect of the agricultural produce produced in that area so far as contention no23 was concerned approving the patna view it was held that in the up act even traders under certain circumstances had been made liable to pay such fee similarly the argument that the market fee can be charged only on those transactions in which the seller is the producer of agricultural produce and not on any other transaction was also found devoid of any substance by the constitution bench in view of the aforesaid pronouncement of the constitution bench therefore it must be held that even if an agricultural produce initially is not grown in the market area and it is brought in manufactured form within the market area for sale such sale transaction in connection with such a produce would be covered by the sweep of the market act the same view was taken by two later judgments of this court in the case of rameshchandra kachardas porwal and others vs state of maharashtra and others etc etc 1981 2 scc 722 1981 indlaw sc 423 wherein a three judge bench of this court speaking through chinnappa reddy j amongst others had to consider the question whether change of location of market under the maharashtra agricultural produce marketing regulation act 1963 could be held to be legally justified it was held that the power to establish principal market or a subsidiary market carried with it the power to disestablish such market and that power to establish principal or submarket yard could be exercised from time to time\n",
      "84 in para 11 of the report the further contention was examined as to whether agricultural produce which is imported into the market area from outside the market would be covered by the sweep of the market act while answering this contention in affirmative it was held that even if agricultural produce is imported into the market area and subjected to sale and purchase thereof in the market area the provisions of the market act would get attracted the very same contention which learned senior counsel shri shanti bhushan urged for our consideration that the act is enacted for the interest of agriculturists only and for their sole benefit was repelled for coming to that conclusion reliance was placed on a decision of the constitution bench of this court in the case of rameshchandra kachardas porwal and others 1981 indlaw sc 423 supra in this connection the following pertinent observations were made at page 735 para 11 of the report the basic assumption of the submission was that the maharashtra agricultural produce marketing regulation act was conceived in the interests of the agriculturists only and intended for their sole benefit this basic assumption is not well founded it is also clear to our mind that the regulation of marketing of agricultural produce if confined to the sales by producers within the market area to traders will very soon lead to its circumvention in the guise of sales by traders to traders or import of agricultural produce from outside the market area to within the market area\n",
      "85 in our view the aforesaid observations are in rameshchandra kachardas porwals case 1981 indlaw sc 423 supra are in consonance with the decision of the constitution bench of this court in ram chandra kailash kumar and company and others supra and are well sustained this very question was once again examined by another three judge bench of this court in the case of rathi khandsari udyog and others vs state of uttar pradesh and others 1985 2 scc 485 1985 indlaw sc 524 wherein fazal ali j speaking for majority relying upon the earlier decisions of this court including the constitution bench judgment in the case of ram chandra kailash kumar and company and others supra considered the very same contention as canvassed by learned senior counsel shri shanti bhushan namely that the market act was meant to protect the agriculturists who produce basic agricultural produce and was not meant to protect big producers having factories wherein they process the raw agricultural produce and manufacture marketable commodity out of it repelling such narrow view of the regulatory provisions of the market act at para 35 of the report the following pertinent observations were made  the legislature it is also argued could not have intended to cover the produce turned out by producers like the petitioners while this is one of the objects of the act it is not the sole or only object of the act the act has many more objects and a much wider perspective such as development of new market areas efficient collection of data and processing of arrivals in mandis with a view to enable the world bank to give substantial economic assistance to establish various markets in uttar pradesh as also protection of consumers and even traders from being exploited in the matter of quality weight and price\n",
      "86 in view of this settled legal position therefore it cannot be held that merely because the tea leaves produced in tea gardens outside the state of bihar are processed by the appellant in its factories outside bihar and are converted into blended and branded qualities of packed tea like red label tea or green label tea etc and even though such packed tea is sold within bihar market areas the market act cannot be applied to such sale transactions of manufactured tea after importing it in the state of bihar the first point therefore has to be rejected that takes us to the second contention in support of the appeal point no2  the tea act of 1953 provides for control by the union government of the tea industry including the control in pursuance of the international agreement now in force of the cultivation of tea in and of the export of tea from india and for that purpose to establish a tea board and levy a duty of excise on tea produced in india it is necessary to have a birds eye view of its relevant provisions s 4 deals with a board called tea board the members of the board not exceeding forty are to be appointed by the central government by notification in the official gazette and would consist of various persons representing  a owners of tea estate and gardens and growers of tea b persons employed in tea estates and gardens c manufacturers of tea d dealers including both exporters and internal traders of tea e consumers f parliament g the government of the principle teagrowing states amongst others s 10 deals with the functions of the board  it provides as under\n",

      "89 however it is pertinent to note that the said act does not provide for regulating the sale of purchased roasted tea leaves after they are subjected to manufacturing process of blending and are brought in the market for sale as packed tea the place where such packed tea is to be sold and the price at which it has to be sold are matters on which the tea act 1953 does not contain any statutory provisions however shri shanti bhushan learned senior counsel for the appellant strongly relied upon s 30 of the act it is true as seen earlier that the said section found in chapter vi deals with control by the central government and lays down the power of the central government regarding control price and distribution of tea or tea waste however it is to be noted that till date no such control order has been issued by the central government under the said provision learned senior counsel submitted that once the central legislature has enacted the aforesaid provision and evinced its intention to control price and distribution of tea or tea waste the field gets occupied by legislation under entry 33 of the concurrent list and to that extent the provisions of market act would get excluded it is not possible to accept this contention for the simple reason that so long as the central government does not issue any order under s 30 of the tea act the field dealing with fixation of maximum price or minimum price to be charged by a grower of tea manufacturer or dealer wholesale or retail for indian market leaving aside the question of export would not be occupied\n",
      "90 in other words it would remain open for the state legislature to cover that field by exercising its legislative power under entry 33 of the concurrent list even this aspect of the matter is also not res integra it is covered by a decision of the constitution bench of this court in ch tika ramji  others etc vs the state of uttar pradesh  others 1956 scr 393 1956 indlaw sc 90 in that case the constitution bench was concerned with the question whether the up sugarcane regulation of supply and purchase act 1953 could be said to have been legally enacted by the uttar pradesh state legislature despite the operation of the idr act which contained a declaration whereby sugarcane industry was sought to be regulated by the idr act section 18g of the act referred to earlier whereunder there was a possibility of the central government issuing appropriate control order to occupy that field was held not to bar the legislative competence of the state legislature to enact appropriate provisions regarding the said industry such a mere possibility of promulgation of order under section 18g of the idr act was held not to have occupied the field whereby the state legislature could not enact appropriate statutory provisions by exercise of its legislative power under entry 33 of list iii bhagwati j speaking for the constitution bench placing reliance on the observations of sulaiman j in the decision of the federal court in shyamakant lal vs rambhajan singh 1939 fcr 188 212 extracted with approval the following passage from the said decision at page 427 of the report as under \n",
      "91 when the question is whether a provincial legislation is repugnant to an existing indian law the onus of showing its repugnancy and the extent to which it is repugnant should be on the party attacking its validity there ought to be a presumption in favour of its validity and every effort should be made to reconcile them and construe both so as to avoid their being repugnant to each other and care should be taken to see whether the two do not really operate in different fields without encroachment further repugnancy must exist in fact and not depend merely on a possibility their lordships can discover no adequate grounds for holding that there exists repugnancy between the two laws in districts of the province of ontario where the prohibitions of the canadian act are not and may never be in force attorneygeneral for ontario v attorneygeneral for the dominion thereafter the following pertinent observations were made by bhagwati j speaking for the constitution bench  in the instant case there is no question of any inconsistency in the actual terms of the acts enacted by parliament and the impugned act the only questions that arise are whether parliament and the state legislature sought to exercise their powers over the same subjectmatter or whether the laws enacted by parliament were intended to be a complete exhaustive code or in other words expressly or impliedly evinced an intention to cover the whole field and thereafter section 18g of the idr act was considered and it was held as under  even assuming that sugarcane was an article or class of articles relatable to the sugar industry within the meaning of section 18g of act lxv of 1951 it is to be noted that no order was issued by the central government in exercise of the powers vested in it under that section and no question of repugnancy could ever arise because as he has noted above repugnancy must exist in fact and not depend merely on a possibility the possibility of an order under section 18g being issued by the central government would not be enough the existence of such an order would be the essential prerequisite before any repugnancy could ever arise\n",
      "92 the aforesaid decision of the constitution bench therefore clearly repels the submission of learned senior counsel shri shanti bhushan that merely because there is a possibility of issuance of a control order under s 30 of the tea act by the central government the field is fully occupied in connection with fixation of the maximum and minimum prices of packed tea to be charged by manufacturer or dealer wholesale or retail or regulating the maximum quantity of packed tea to be sold to any person in a later decision of the bench of two learned judges to which one of us sujata v manohar j was a party the very same view has been reiterated relying upon the aforesaid decision in ch tika ramji  others etc vs the state of uttar pradesh  others 1956 indlaw sc 90 supra the latter decision is rendered in the case of siel ltd and others 1998 indlaw sc 1288 vs union of india and others supra as noted earlier it must therefore be held that mere possibility of issuance of any future order under s 30 1 of the tea act by the central government in the absence of any existing express order to that effect cannot be said to have occupied the field regarding purchase and sale of manufactured tea and fixation of maximum or minimum price thereof or the location of such sales these topics cannot be said to be legitimately covered by the tea act\n",
      "93 hence the field is wide open for the state legislature to exercise its concurrent legislative power under entry 33 of list iii for effectively dealing with these matters this is precisely what has been done by the state legislature by enacting the market act the insertion of item pertaining to tea leaf and dust in the schedule therefore cannot be said to be an unauthorised exercise on the part of the delegate of the state legislature namely the state government which has exercised its power under s 39 of the market act before parting with the discussion on the tea act it is also necessary to keep in view the history of tea industry in india it is apparent that the tea committee 1934 indian tea control act 1938 and central tea board act 1949 had been made with a view to control export of tea and tea cultivation the tea act 1953 was enacted to provide for taking several functions of licensing and vesting it in the board and to exercise 1 control over tea cultivation and 2 control over the export of tea and tea seeds the preamble of the act states that it is intended to provide for the control by the union of the tea industry including the control in pursuance of the international agreement of the cultivation of tea and export of tea thus the objective of the tea act is focussed on tea cultivationtea export and establishment of tea manufacturing plants it is quite different from that of the market act 1960 made by the bihar legislature the tea act has no concern with the establishment of markets in the state of bihar or other states wherein packed tea could be sold in wholesale or retail markets so as to ultimately reach the indian consumers that takes us to the consideration of the control orders issued by the central government in exercise of its power under section 30 subss 3 and 5 thereof one such order is the tea distribution and export control order 1957 which pertains to licensing of the distributors and exporters of tea cl 3 requires distributors carrying on the business of distributing tea to have a licence under this order the export of tea is not touched by the market act as it has nothing to do with the export of tea to other countries cl 9 says that the licence given is personal and nontransferable cl 10 requires the licensee to pack and mark containers of tea in the manner mentioned therein the proviso is significant\n",
      "94 according to it cl 10 c does not apply to containers containing not more than 20 kg net or such other weight as to make it package tea for the purpose of the central excises and salt act 1944 cl 11 provides that no distributor shall distribute tea for sale which is not packed and marketed as per cl 10 and which is adulterated or which makes false claim for such tea thereafter are noted various statutory requirements firstly the distributor contemplated by the 1957 order is a distributor in the commercial sense who as principal or agent distributes tea to the wholesaler secondly the distribution controlled is linked with export thirdly since distribution is clubbed with export it can at best be said to be distribution which is being made in similar bulk as exports fourthly form a provides for granting of licence to carry on business in manufactured tea as distributors at the places mentioned in the application while form b deals with licence to carry on business in manufactured tea as distributorexporter of tea it thus becomes at once clear that this control order does not command licencee to carry on distribution of tea for sale at any particular placemarket the aforesaid control order has nothing to do with the establishment of markets for selling packed tea the requirement of packing and marketing is again not contemplated by the market act 1960\n",
      "95 hence it is difficult to appreciate how this control order has occupied the field of regulation of sale and purchase of packed tea in market areas the next order on which shri shanti bhushan learned senior counsel for the appellant strongly relied was the tea marketing control order 1984 the said order was promulgated by the central government in exercise of its power under subss 3 and 5 of s 30 of the tea act 1953 it pertains to licensing of the distributors and exporters a mere look at the said order shows that it does not provide for any regulation of sale and purchase of tea in the markets in different states in india cl 3 requires registration of manufacturer of tea and such manufacturer has to submit monthly return under cl 5 in form c cls 6 and 7 pertain to organiser of tea auction and broker in tea auction cl 14 declares that the licence is personal and nontransferable these persons are to maintain records as per cl 16 cl 17 directs the manufacturer to sell not less than 75 or such higher percentage as specified by the board of tea manufactured by him in a year through public tea auctions in india held under the control of organisers of tea auction cl 19 exempts tea marketed directly by the manufacturer as packet tea instant tea tea bags aromatic tea and green tea from computation of the total production under para 17 firstly 1984 order deals with manufacturers and organisers of tea auction and brokers of tea auction and its basic concern is to require them to have licences in the form of authority\n",
      "96 it is obvious that even this order cannot advance the case of the appellant the next order which was pressed in service was the tea warehouses licensing order 1989 the said order was also promulgated by the central government in exercise of the power conferred by subss 3 and 5 of s 30 of the tea act 1953 a mere look at the salient features of 1989 order shows that it has not covered the field tried to be occupied by the market act the public tea auctions contemplated by 1984 order are those which are held under cl 3 of the tea warehouses licensing order 1989 in fact cl 147 prohibits the warehouse owner from entering into any transaction with the manufacturerbrokerorganiser of tea auction unless they have licences under the 1984 order the public tea auctions are held in specified areas in calcutta siliguri guwahati cochin coimbatore and amritsar thus the 1984 order and the tea warehouses licensing order 1989 are basically concerned with the public tea auctions and the licensing of manufacturerbrokerorganiser of public auction and warehouses with regard to holding of public tea auctions the warehouse is to be governed as per cl 107 of the 1989 order this order does not apply to the storage godowns in the markets established under the market act 1960 but assuming it applies the only effect would be that the storage places in markets should be in conformity with cl 107 as far as obtaining of licence is concerned it has to be obtained by the warehouse owner who carries on the activities of storing blending or packing of tea in the warehouse once the manufacturer or trader takes space from the market committee in the godown in the market yard then he would be the warehouse owner ucl 21 of the 1989 order and would have to take a licence as authority from the tea board both under the 1984 order and 1989 order there is no requirement to carry on the business at any particular placemarket these orders do not concern themselves with establishment of market or fixing place of business\n",
      "97 the aforesaid orders on which reliance was placed by learned senior counsel shri shanti bhushan indicate that the central government in its wisdom did not think it fit to issue any order under section 30 subsection 1 cls a  b and therefore kept the field wide open in connection with the topics covered by the said provisions of s 30 for the state governments to exercise their legislative powers and enact suitable legislations under entry 33 of the concurrent list iii of the seventh schedule of the constitution our attention was then invited by shri shanti bhushan learned senior counsel for the appellant to the tea waste control order 1959 even this order is issued by the central government under subss 3 and 5 of s 30 the tea waste control order 1959 applies only to tea waste as defined in cl 2 f thereunder a person sellingoffering for salebuyingholding any stock in tea waste is required to have licence clauses 345 and 6 cl 9 provides that licence is not transferable cl 13 provides that licensee shall have in possession tea waste not exceeding that which may be fixed by the licensing authority under clause 19a false declaration is prohibited on a conjoint reading of the aforesaid statutory orders issued under the tea act and the relevant scheme of the tea act it becomes at once clear that the provisions regarding fixation of appropriate price at which blended and packed tea can be sold to wholesalers in any established market or particular place at which sale transactions of such manufactured tea between the manufacturers on the one hand and the traders or other wholesale producersdealers on the other are outside the sweep either of the tea act or of the relevant statutory orders framed under s 30 by the central government under the very same act\n",
      "98 the places at which public auctions can be held in connection with sale of roasted tea leaves to be purchased by manufacturers like the appellant are the earmarked six places indicated in 1984 and 1989 orders these auctions have nothing to do with the later sales of manufactured blended tea by such auction purchasers of tea leaves who manufacture packed tea by blending and packing roasted tea leaves in their factories the public auctions as contemplated by these orders therefore serve out their purpose once the manufacturers of blended tea like the appellants purchase roasted tea leaves in public auctions once such purchased tea leaves are further processed after blending and packed in suitable receptacles for sale in local markets the stage is reached for regulating such sale transactions by manufacturers of tea when they are subjected to further auctions to be held in the market areas wherein the licensed distributors and manufacturers of tea can be subjected to the procedure of section 15 subs 2 of the market act so far as these later transactions are concerned neither the tea act nor any of the aforesaid orders can hold the field such sale transactions of manufactured tea in packed condition will therefore necessarily have to be governed by the provisions of the market act applicable to the area wherein such sale transactions in favour of wholesalers or retailers are effected by the stockists of the appellant operating in the market areas concerned it is also pertinent to note that s 15 of the market act gets attracted to such transactions of sale it is not possible to agree with the contention of learned senior counsel shri shanti bhushan that once the retail prices are fixed by the appellant there is no necessity of auctioning this tea in packed condition as per s 15 subs 2 of the market act it has to be kept in view that under the relevant orders issued by the central government under s 30 of the tea act as noted earlier the purchasers of tea have also to be licensed such licensed purchasers can bid at the auctions to be held as per section 15 subs 2 of the market act for purchasing such packed tea at that stage there is no inconsistency or conflict between the earlier public auction held under the relevant statutory orders issued under s 30 of the tea act concerning roasted tea leaves and the auction of packed and processed tea by the appellant selling such commodities in the market areas through their stockists to wholesale dealers and traders operating in the market area and the market yard or submarket yards concerned\n",
      "99 in this connection we may note one other submission of learned senior counsel shri shanti bhushan for the appellant he submitted that for almost 16 years tea was not a scheduled item governed by the market act in fact the bihar legislature did not think it fit to include tea leaf and dust as a scheduled item from the inception but it is only the delegate namely the state of bihar in exercise of its power under s 39 thought it fit to introduce tea leaf and dust as a scheduled item the procedure of ss 3 and 4 has not to be followed while undertaking this exercise in this connection it was submitted that no reasonable person could have undertaken such an exercise as tea was already a controlled commodity under the tea act and also governed by the relevant orders issued thereunder as we have seen earlier under the relevant provisions of the tea act and the operative orders promulgated thereunder the central government has left untouched the field of regulation of prices and the location of market places where such packed tea could be sold to the wholesale dealers or even to the retailers when that field was wide open the state government in its wisdom could legitimately try to cover the filed by issuing appropriate orders under s 39 of the act it cannot be said therefore that such an exercise was totally ultra vires or amounted to nonapplication of mind in fact what the central government should have done and did not do by issuing appropriate orders under section 30 subs 1 cls a  b of the tea act could legitimately be done by the state government it was not required to wait indefinitely till the central government could find time to issue such an order shri shanti bhushan in this connection further submitted that if that is so then if in future the central government wakes up and issues such an order would the then existing entry in the schedule regarding tea get superseded or become inoperative  this is a hypothetical question raised which does not require any answer obviously at this stage\n",
      "100 as and when in future such an eventuality occurs then the question of continuation of regulation of sale and purchase transactions of tea leaf and dust by retaining this item in the schedule may have to be examined but as the statutory provisions stand at present in the absence of any such existing order under s 30 subs 1 cls a  b by the central government the field remains wide open and at least it was definitely open when the state government introduced the entry of tea leaf and dust in the schedule to the market act in 1976 this exercise by no stretch of imagination could be said to be unauthorised illegal or amounting to nonapplication of mind the second contention therefore is answered in negative against the appellant and in favour of the respondent that takes us to the consideration of contention no3 point no 3  once it is held that the market act covers the transactions of sale of packed blended tea in sealed packets and receptacles by the appellants stockist in the market areas concerned especially when these transactions take place in the market yard or submarket yards as laid down by s 15 of the act which remains fully operative to cover such transactions there is no escape from the conclusion that the entire infrastructural facilities for regulation of such sale transactions as made available by the market committee concerned would enure for the benefit of sellers of such packed blended tea it is also pertinent to note that so far as the appellant is concerned all that is required of it is to take licence for selling packed tea in market yards submarket yards from the market committee concerned the appellant is not required to bear the burden of any market fee\n",
      "as per s 27 of the act the burden of market fee is to be borne by the purchasers of such packed tea namely the wholesale dealers licensed to purchase such tea as per the central orders mentioned earlier such purchasers have not brought in challenge levy of market fee on them so far as the appellant is concerned once its stockist sells the packed tea in the market yard or submarket yards maintained by the market committee the entire infrastructural facilities made available by the market committee to all the purchasers and sellers of agricultural produce in the market yard would automatically become available to the appellants stockist who sells its goods namely packed tea in the market yard or submarket yards concerned in this connection it has also to be kept in view that establishment of markets and maintenance thereof is a topic of legislation squarely covered by entry 28 of list ii of the seventh schedule for maintaining such markets the market committees obviously have to spend large amounts for providing necessary infrastructure for the benefit of those who use such established markets in this connection s 30 of the market act as noted earlier becomes relevant for our consideration amongst others the market committee fund has to be utilised under s 30 for the following purposes \n",
      "i the acquisition of a site or site for the market\n",
      "ii the maintenance and improvement of the market\n",

      "101 all these provisions clearly indicate that once the transaction of sale or purchase of any agricultural produce is governed by the act and once s 15 of the act applies to such transaction the entire machinery of the act would get attracted to regulate such transaction and the complete infrastructure for which provisions are made by the market committee including the facilities available at such markets would become available to the purchasers and sellers of such commodities in the market for providing these infrastructural facilities the market committee has to spend from its funds this would supply adequate quid pro quo for levying market fee on the buyers of commodities sold at its market yard or submarket yard it is therefore not possible to agree with the learned senior counsel for the appellant that there is no quid pro quo underlying transactions of sale of packed tea by the appellants stockist in the market yard or submarket yards maintained by the market committee concerned the third contention therefore is to be answered in affirmative against the appellant and in favour of the respondent before parting with this appeal it is necessary to briefly deal with the written submissions furnished in support of the appeal by learned counsel after arguments were over and which have already been dealt with by us in detail hereinabove so far as the written submissions filed by the appellant on 8th may 1999 are concerned we may state that to the extent they tried to reiterate what was submitted earlier and considered by us will stand repelled in the light of the detailed reasons recorded by us earlier in this connection processing of packed tea manufactured out of tea leaves purchased by the appellant in the auction at six places obviously is not covered by the applicability of the market act in the present case all that the market act seeks to cover is the sale transactions pertaining to packed tea branded and marked in accordance with the regulations made by the tea board to the extent these sealed packets are sold by the appellant within the market area these transactions of sale of packed tea as discussed by us earlier would squarely attract the applicability of the market act as they take place within the market area governed by the market act\n",
      "102 as seen earlier manufacturing activities concerning this packed tea has no relevance for arriving at an appropriate answer to this question contention raised in para 2 of the written submissions is also besides the point whether other states levy market fee or not is not at all relevant the bihar legislation may be a pioneer in this field the short question is whether the market act can govern the transaction of sale of packed manufactured tea by the appellant within the market areas in the state of bihar  so far as this question is concerned the aforesaid contention can be of no assistance to the appellant contention in para 3 of the written submissions about the basic object of the bihar market act and whether it should ensure only the protection to the grower of the agricultural produce within the market area stands repelled by a constitution bench judgment of this court to which a detailed reference has been made in the earlier part of this judgment para 4 of the written submissions deals with various statutory provisions of the tea act of 1953 and the relevant control orders thereunder as discussed earlier the schemes of the tea act and the control orders do not cover the field carved out by the market act for bringing within its sweep transactions of sale of agriculture produce encompassed by the wider definition thereof under that act insofar as such produce is sold within the market area to which the market act applies it is difficult to appreciate the contention in para 8 of the written submissions to the effect that the state had not applied its mind in bringing tea within the sweep of the market act in exercise of its power under s 39 of the act as discussed earlier this contention is devoid of any substance contention in para 9 of the written submissions is also devoid of any merit it is not the case of the appellant that the sale of manufactured tea in bihar markets within the market area of the concerned market committee requires the appellant to bear the burden of the market fee\n",
      "103 it is obvious as seen earlier that charge of market fee is on the buyer of branded tea and not on the seller thereof like the appellant the purchasers of branded market tea manufactured by the appellant who purchase the said produce in market areas governed by the market act have made no grievance in this connection even otherwise as seen earlier once the wide definition of agricultural produce as found in the market act governs such sale transactions and when s 15 of the act covers such transactions the charge us 27 would obviously get settled on these transactions as a logical corollary thereof even if the appellant may have to act as a collecting agent for the market committee concerned as per its legal obligation in given circumstances that by itself cannot exonerate it once the statutory scheme of the act covers transactions of sale of branded tea carried out by the appellant in the market area governed by the market act contentions found in para 10 of the written submissions are to be stated to be rejected once the sale transactions of packed tea are governed by the sweep of the market act and once such sale transactions have to be regulated as per the machinery of the market act on the applicability of s 15 of the act the entire infrastructure available for regulating such sale transactions at the market yard or submarket yards whose benefit would obviously be available to the appellant cannot entitle the appellant to contend that its fundamental right uart 191g of the constitution is violated to say the least it would be a reasonable restriction on exercise of such a right it is pertinent to note that the appellant has not challenged the vires of s 27 of the market act it is difficult to appreciate the submission that compelling the sealed and packed tea to be brought into the market yard and to be auctioned thereof cannot be considered to advance the public interest in any manner public interest obviously gets advanced as the sale transactions will get regulated by the infrastructural machinery at the market yard and submarket yards concerned where such transactions take place\n",
      "104 the contention that the bihar act would be unconstitutional cannot be countenanced for twin reasons firstly such a contention was not canvassed either before the high court or before this court in the present proceedings secondly in any case on the applicability of the act once the transaction of sale of packed tea takes place in the market area it cannot but be said to be imposing reasonable restriction under art 19 subart 6 on the appellants fundamental right the appellant as a seller of manufactured tea has not to bear any burden of the imposed market fee on sale transactions all that it gets is the benefit of the infrastructural facilities made available by the market committee for regulating such transactions and if the appellant is likely to get more price for its branded tea by subjecting its sale transactions to auction instead of the said provision adversely affecting the appellant would on the contrary be more beneficial to it maybe the appellant from commercial point of view may not like to charge higher price for the packed tea from its customers but that does not mean that the infrastructural facilities made available by the market committees to the appellant to get more price of its branded tea if so desired by it can be construed in any way to be adversely affecting its commercial business interests for obvious reasons therefore none of the contentions found in the written submissions can advance the case of the appellants and they necessarily have to stand repelled these were the only contentions canvassed by learned senior counsel in support of the appeal and as they fail the inevitable result is that this appeal fails and will be liable to be dismissed final order  as a net result of the aforesaid discussion therefore the following orders are passed  1 sugar group matters these appeals namely civil appeal nos 398 and 3991977 2341995 81631994 74321994 2632331982 12821995 are allowed the judgments and orders passed by the high court impugned in these appeals are set aside the writ petition no 12501986 filed by the petitioner will stand allowed accordingly as detailed in this judgment subject to the riders mentioned hereinabove civil appeal nos450005 of 1992 so far as they seek to challenge the levy of market fee on sugar are concerned will stand allowed the respective six petitions filed before the high court dealing with levy of market fee on sugar will stand allowed civil appeal arising out of slp c no9684 of 1992 will stand allowed to the extent civil writ petition no5974 of 1988 filed before the high court deals with the contention regarding market fee on sugar instead of the relief granted by the high court limiting to the nonlevy of market fee on sugar after 251977 it is directed that levy of market fee on sugar for the entire period covered by the writ petition will be treated to be unauthorised this judgment will have only prospective operation and will not affect past transactions entered into prior to the date of this judgment\n",

      "1  this appeal is preferred by the convicted accused by name sohrabkhan aged about 26 years as on the date of the occurrence on being aggrieved by the judgment of the high court rendered in criminal appeal no 26 of 1976 on the file of the high court of madhya pradesh at indore bench by setting aside the judgment of the trial court acquitting him of the offences punishable under section 302 and section 323 ipc and under section 27 of the arms act and further convicting him of the abovesaid offences and sentencing to life imprisonment under section 302 ipc and to other various terms of imprisonment for other offences the matrix of the prosecution case can be summarised as follows\n",
      "2   the appellant is the son of one ishaq khan the appellant and his father were on inimical terms with the deceased aziz khan who was none other than the nephew of ishaq khan there was dispute over the enjoyment of a portion of land between these two parties\n",
      "3  on august 20 1973 at about 730 am the deceased was grazing his cattle in the field whilst his brother pw 3 latif was cutting grass in the nearby field at that point of time ishaq khan armed with a gun accompanied by his son the appellant herein armed with a stick came to the scene of occurrence it is stated that ishaq khan handed over his gun to the appellant and instigated him to shoot at aziz khan\n",
      "4  on the instigation of his father the appellant fired a shot causing injuries to aziz khan thereafter the appellant assaulted aziz khan with a stick and when pw 3 rushed to the scene of occurrence and intervened he too was assaulted by the appellant with a stick after causing injuries to the deceased and pw 3 the appellant and his father made good their escape thereafter the injured aziz khan was carried to badagaon hospital where pw 2 rendered the firstaid and advised the parties to take the injured to nalkhoda hospital at the nalkhoda hospital the injured was examined by pw 14 a medical officer of that hospital\n",
      "5  pw 3 lodged the fir ex p 4 on the same day at about 11 am at nalkhoda police station which is situated about 14 kms from the scene of occurrence as the condition of the injured aziz khan became serious he was advised to be taken to the civil hospital ujjain under the advice of the medical officer a dying declaration of the deceased was recorded by pw 17 naib tehsildar under ex p 20 however the injured aziz khan succumbed to his injuries on august 23 1973 the investigating officer completed the investigation and filed the chargesheet against the accused ie the respondent and his father\n",
      "6  the trial court rejected the dying declaration ex p 20 for the reasons mentioned in its judgment and on that basis discarded the testimony of pw 3 and finally concluded that the prosecution has not made out the case against the appellant and his father and consequently acquitted them the state thereafter preferred the appeal before the high court which allowed the appeal as stated above\n",
      "7  the totality of the evidence adduced by the prosecution is twofold one the direct evidence of pw 3 who is an injured witness and two the dying declaration ex p 20 recorded by pw 17 at the hospital pw 3 though is the brother of the deceased aziz khan his presence at the scene of occurrence cannot be disputed because he too had received an injury on his hand on being beaten by the appellant with a stick  further in the present case the relationship does not play an important role because both the parties were closely related to each other pw 3 has given a full account of what had happened at the scene of occurrence and has testified to the fact that aziz khan received a gunshot injury at the hands of the appellant on being instigated by his father ishaq khan\n",
      "8  in ex p 20 the deceased has given a full account of the incident stating that it was the appellant who shot at him at the instance of his father the trial court had discarded the dying declaration only on the ground that the deceased had implicated the brother of the appellant as having been present at the time of occurrence in our view the mere mentioning of the presence of the brother of the appellant at the scene cannot be said to have whittled down the veracity of the dying declaration the high court in its judgment while dealing with ex p 20 has observed as follows\n",
      "having gone through his pw 3 testimony we find that the reasons given by the trial court for discarding it are perverse we see no valid reason to disbelieve the testimony of this witness\n",
      "turning to the dying declaration ex p 20 recorded on the date of incident by pw 17 lakhanlal shah naib tehsildar ujjain we find that it substantially corroborates the testimony of the eyewitness as to the part played by each accused in the crime\n",
      "9  this court in vadivelu thevar v state of madras 1957 indlaw sc 711957 indlaw sc 711957 indlaw sc 71 has laid down the dictum that the evidence of a single witness if wholly reliable a conviction can be safely based on that evidence alone after going through the evidence of pw 3 we are convinced that his evidence is wholly reliable and it does not suffer from any infirmity ex p 20 is also a document which can be accepted and acted upon\n",
      "10   in the result we are in full agreement with the conclusion arrived at by the high court relying upon the testimony of pw 3 and the dying declaration ex p 20 we also on scrutinising the evidence carefully notwithstanding the reasoning of the high court unhesitatingly come to the conclusion that the prosecution has made out the case against the appellant by leading formidable evidence\n",

      "4 the first respondent is a society which was originally incorporated in the year 1914 the full particulars of such incorporation are not available at this juncture on record and are also not necessary for the present purpose it is sufficient to state that it is admitted on all hands that it is a housing cooperative society and the act governs the affairs of the said society\n",
      "5 it is also an admitted fact on all hands that the said society has different classes of members known as owners lessees allottees tenants etc it is also an admitted fact that the total membership is 762 out of which 69 members fall under the classification of tenant members however the exact rights and obligations of these various classes of members visavis the first respondent society or these various classes of members inter se are also not available on record\n",
      "6 it appears from the record that as on today the first respondent society owns an extent of approximately 2177410 sq mts of land in the city of mumbai alongwith structures popularly known as wellingdon catholic colony it appears that the said property was part of a larger parcel of land earlier owned by the first respondent society but is not owned by the society now some of the tenant members including the appellants herein of the society initiated proceedings for the division of the society sometime in the year 1970 invoking s 18 of the act by making an application to the registrar the said application has a very long and chequered history the details of which are not necessary for the present purpose except to state that by virtue of the judgment under appeal the application is still open and pending\n",
      "7 in the meanwhile in a resolution came to be passed on the 6th december 2009 by the general body of the society to sell the above mentioned land in favour of respondents no22 and 23 in furtherance of the said resolution a sale deedconveyance came to be executed on 7th december 2009 aggrieved by the said resolution and the sale two suits 144 and 1452010 came to be filed invoking the original jurisdiction of the bombay high court a copy of the plaint in the suit no1452010 is placed on record in these slps the principal prayer in both the civil suits is\n",
      "a for a declaration that the said resolution dated 6th december 2009 exhibit k hereto and the said conveyance dated 7th december 2009 exhibit m hereto are invalid illegal and void ab initio andor the same are voidable as against the plaintiffs and the tenant members of defendant no17 association ai that this honble court be pleased to pass order declaring s 164 of maharashtra cooperative societies act 12 violation of art 14 of the constitution of india and the same ought to be struck down\n",
      "it can be seen from prayer a extracted above that the plaintiffs seek in effect two declarations \n",
      "i that a resolution dated 6th november 2009 of the first respondent society and\n",
      "ii a conveyance dated 7th december 2009 executed on behalf of the first respondent society in favour of respondents 22 and 23 are either illegal void ab initio or in the alternative that they are voidable as against the plaintiffs of whom at least some are the appellants herein and claim to be the tenant members of the respondent society we may state here that there is a dispute regarding the membership of some of the appellants herein but for the present case we do not go into the dispute but refer the appellants only for the sake of convenience as tenant members\n",
      "the substance of the factual and legal basis asserted in the plaint on which the plaintiffs seek the two declarations referred to earlier in the civil suits and argued at the bar is that the tenant members alone have the right title and interest over the property sought to be sold by the impugned conveyance dated 7th december 2009 and that the other members of the society have no right title or interest in the property in dispute the plaintiffs expect an order of bifurcation of the respondent no1 society and also to get a declaration in their favour of the right title and interest in the property in dispute the plaintiffs also therefore claimed appropriate interim orders regarding the property during the pendency of the suits\n",
      "8 the defendants raised a preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of the suits in view of ss 91 and 163 of the act which was rejected by a learned single judge but found favour with the division bench of the bombay high court resulting in that part of the judgment which is under appeal now\n",
      "9 by the judgment under appeal it is held that\n",
      "in our opinion therefore what is principally challenged in the civil suit is the resolution of the general body and challenge to the conveyance is ancillary\n",
      "and therefore opined\n",
      "that the plaintiffs could have filed the dispute before the cooperative court challenging the resolution of the general body and the consequent execution of conveyance in favour of ms sumer associates and could have joined ms sumer associates as a defendant in that dispute in our opinion thus the entire subject matter of the civil suit could have been the subject matter of the dispute filed us 91\n",
      "10 shri mukul rohtagi and dr abhishek m singhvi learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants argued that irrespective of the fact whether a declaration regarding illegality of the impugned resolution dated 6th december 2009 could be granted by the ordinary civil courts in view of s 91 of the act a declaration regarding the voidness of the impugned conveyance dated 7th december 2009 could only be given by a competent civil court contemplated us 9 of the code of civil procedure hereinafter the code for short because such conveyance is in favour of a person who is not a member of the society\n",
      "it is submitted that the ultimate dispute and grievance of the plaintiffs is against the alienation of the property in favour of the respondents 22 and 23 herein by the impugned conveyance which has the effect of depriving the plaintiffs of their right title and interest in the property in dispute such a conveyance could only be declared illegal and void ab initio by a competent civil court contemplated us 9 of the code the impugned resolution which purportedly authorises the sale of the property covered by the impugned conveyance by itself does not transfer or create any interest in the property adverse to the interest of the plaintiffs\n",
      "therefore even if it is assumed that the legality of the impugned resolution is amenable to the jurisdiction of the cooperative court functioning under section 91 the suits in question could not have been held to be not maintainable as the jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the incidental question regarding the impugned resolution dated 6th december 2009 would stand subsumed by the jurisdiction of the competent civil court which alone is competent to decide the legality of the impugned conveyance dated 7th december 2009 the learned counsel further argued that the ouster of the jurisdiction conferred on the civil courts us 9 of the code is to be conceded only where there is an express exclusion by the language of the statute or if such an ouster arises by a necessary implication from the scheme of a particular statute it is argued that there is nothing either in the language of s 91 or the scheme of the act which would lead to a conclusion that the jurisdiction conferred us 9 of the code is excluded to adjudicate the suits in question\n",
      "11 on the question of interim order during the pendency of the suits the learned counsel argued that in view of the pendency of the claim of the plaintiff for the bifurcation of the respondent society and according to the appellants they have a very strong case the disputed property must be preserved as it is and the balance of convenience is in favour of the appellants the learned counsel argued that the high court grossly erred in examining the maintainability of the suits in the interlocutory application filed by the plaintiff seeking interim order\n",
      "12 on the other hand learned senior counsel shri ca sundaram appearing for the respondents argued that the language of section 91 subs 1c of the act clearly indicates that the jurisdiction of the cooperative court contemplated under s 91 is not confined only to the adjudication of the disputes between the society and its members or servants etc enumerated in s 911a b d and e but also extends to the disputes where one of the parties to the dispute is a person other than a member of the society\n",
      "13 according to the learned counsel such conclusion is irresistible from the language of s 911 c and s 94 3 ahence the judgment under appeal does not call for any interference\n",
      "14 shri kk venugopal learned senior counsel submitted that the course adopted by the bombay high court in examining the maintainability of the suits in the interlocutory application filed by the plaintiffs is not only justified but also mandatory in view of the language of section 9a of the civil procedure code inserted by the state legislation of maharashtra\n",
      "15 on the question of interim arrangement to be made during the pendency of the suit learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the suit itself is based on the expectancy that the tenant members would succeed in their application for the bifurcation of the society and upon bifurcation the tenant members would be entitled for the exclusive title and possession of the disputed property even if the above mentioned understanding of the plaintiffs is right since the plaintiffs are only some of the tenant members of the society they would not be entitled for the title and possession of the entire disputed property but only a part of it it is argued that since other tenant members have no objection to the alienation of the property in dispute in favour of the respondent no 22 and 23 impeding of conveyance dated 7th december 2009 would not be justified as the impugned resolution and the conveyance have made adequate provisions for safeguarding the interest if any of the appellants\n",
      "16 we shall now examine the issue of maintainability of the suits as rightly contended by the learned counsel for the appellants the civil courts jurisdiction to adjudicate civil disputes is unlimited subject only to the limitations imposed by law either expressly or by necessary implications the law in this regard is well settled and needs no elaboration therefore it becomes necessary for us to examine whether there is anything in the language of s 91 or s 163 which expressly excludes the jurisdiction of the civil courts in the context of the suits in question s 163 of the act bars the jurisdiction of civil and revenue courts reads as follows\n",

      "1 save as expressly provided in this act no civil or revenue court shall have any jurisdiction in respect of\n",

      "before a dispute can be referred to a cooperative court under the provisions of s 911 of the said act it is not only essential that the dispute should be of a kind 1 cooperative court means a court constituted under this act to decide disputes referred to it under any of the provisions of the act described in subs 1 of s 91 but it is also essential that the parties to the said dispute must belong to any of the categories specified in cls a to e of sub s 1 of the said section\n",
      "both the subject matter as well as the parties to the dispute must be those specified under the section in other words if either of the above mentioned two requirements is not satisfied then the dispute cannot be adjudicated by the cooperative court if one of the parties to the dispute is not an enumerated person the question whether the subject matter of the dispute is one which falls exclusively within the jurisdiction of the cooperative court need not be examined similarly if it is found in a given case that the subject matter of dispute is not covered by section 91 an enquiry into the question whether the parties to the dispute fall under any of the categories enumerated under s 91 would become irrelevant\n",
      "23 however learned counsel for the respondent argued that in view of the language of s 911 c and s 943 the various classes of persons contemplated under s 91 to bring the dispute within the jurisdiction of the cooperative court if the subject matter of the dispute is otherwise exclusively amenable to the jurisdiction of the cooperative court includes persons other than the members of the society though not covered by clauses a b d and e of s 911\n",

      "24 to examine the correctness of the submissions made by shri ca sundaram it requires an analysis of s 911c and 94 3 when s 911c stipulates that persons other than the members of the society with whom the society has any transaction as one of the classes of persons who could be parties to a dispute amenable exclusively to the jurisdiction of the cooperative court such a class is not an unqualified class the said subsection further qualifies the said class by expressly mentioning that the transactions of such persons with a society should be a transactions in respect of which restrictions and regulations have been made or prescribed under sections 43 44 or 45 of the act therefore to understand the exact nature of the above mentioned class an examination of the scheme of sections 43 44 is necessary\n",
      "25 s 43 1 reads as follows\n",
      "43 1 a society shall receive deposits and loans from members and other persons only to such extent and under such conditions as may be prescribed or specified by the bylaws of the society\n",
      "the said provision recognises the legal authority of a cooperative society to receive deposits and loans either from the members or other persons it further stipulates that the receipt of deposits and loans is permissible only to the extent and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed\n",
      "26 s 44 on the other hand deals with the legal authority of the cooperative society to make a loanlend money s 44 in so far as it is relevant reads as follows\n",
      "441 no society shall make a loan to any person other than a member or on the security of its own shares or on the security of any person who is not a member provided that with the special sanction of the registrar a society may make loans to another society\n",
      "2 notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing subsection a society may make a loan to a depositor on the security of his deposit\n",
      "3 \n",
      "it can be seen from subs 1 that it prohibits a society from lending money to a person other than a member it also prohibits lending of money by the society even to a member on the security of the shares of the same society further it also prohibits lending of money to a member on security to a person who is not a member however the proviso to subs 1 authorises a society to lend money to any other society with the special sanction of the registrar\n",
      "27 subs 2 expressly authorises the society to lend money to a depositor on the security of his deposits such an authorisation is declared to be notwithstanding anything contained in subs 1 in other words the restriction contained in sub s 1 that a society shall not lend money to a person other than a member is relaxed with reference to a depositor who is not a member of the society as we have already noticed under s 43 that the deposits or loans can be received by a society not only from its members but also from persons other than members\n",
      "28 s 45 makes a general declaration that the transactions of the society with persons other than its members shall be subject to such restrictions as may be prescribed s 45 reads as follows\n",
      "45 save as is provided in this act the transactions of a society with persons other than members shall be subject to such restrictions if any as may be prescribed\n",
      "29 therefore where s 91 1 c speaks of persons other than the members of the society it is actually referring to persons other than the members of the society who have deposited money with the society or who have either lent or borrowed money from the society in accordance with the provisions of ss 43 and 44 and subject to the conditions and limitations if any prescribed with reference to such lending to or borrowing from the society\n",
      "30 coming to the language and scheme of s 943 s 941 enumerates the powers of the cooperative court such as the power of summoning the witness and documents etc sub s 3a reads as follows\n",
      "94 procedure for settlement of disputes and power of cooperative court xxx xxx xxx xxx\n",
      "3a if the cooperative court is satisfied that a person whether he be a member of the society or not has acquired any interest in the property of a person who is a party to a dispute it may order that the person who has acquired the interest in the property may join as a party to the dispute and any decision that may be passed on the reference by the cooperative court shall be binding on the party so joined in the same manner as if he were an original party to the dispute\n",
      "emphasis supplied\n",
      "the substance of subs 3a is that if the cooperative court in the course of adjudication of a dispute is satisfied that any person other than a party to the dispute has acquired any interest in the property of a party to a dispute then the cooperative court is empowered to implead such a 3rd party as a party to the dispute such a 3rd party may or may not even be a member of the society the subsection further declares such an impleaded 3rd party to be bound by the decision of the cooperative court\n",
      "31 it is argued by shri ca sundaram learned senior counsel for the respondents that the scheme and language of s 943a makes it beyond doubt that the cooperative courts jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute is not confined only to the disputes between the various classes of persons enumerated under s 91 alone but extends to others also if such a 3rd party even in a case where he happen to be a nonmember acquires some interest in the property of either the society or the members or any other person enumerated in s 91\n",
      "32 we find it difficult to accept the submissions of shri sundaram for the reason if really the legislature intended that the cooperative court should have jurisdiction in all the disputes irrespective of the nature of the dispute arising between the various classes of persons enumerated in s 91 and nonmember 3rd parties who acquire any interest in the property of such enumerated persons the legislature could have clearly indicated the same in s 91 itself it must be remembered that s 943a does not enable a person other than an enumerated person to refer a dispute to the cooperative court the said legal position is made clear in marine times 1990 indlaw sc 513 supra\n",
      "it was a case where a member of a housing society occupying a part of the building owned by the society agreed to sell that property to a 3rd party subject to the approval of the society the society declined approval the 3rd party raised a dispute against the society as well as the member before the cooperative court dealing with the question whether the cooperative court would have jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute this court answered the question in the negative\n",
      "33 accepting the submission of shri sundaram would lead to a situation that while on one hand it is the settled position of law that the act does not permit a person other than the one enumerated under s 91 to seek adjudication of his dispute with enumerated persons in a cooperative court such a court would be authorised by virtue of s 943a to adjudicate a dispute between an enumerated person and a nonmember 3rd party if raised by an enumerated person\n",
      "on the other hand from the language of the said subsection it appears that the only circumstance which enables the cooperative court to exercise its jurisdiction against such a 3rd party is that while adjudicating a dispute which is otherwise amenable to its jurisdiction the co operative court reaches the conclusion that a 3rd party acquired some interest in the property of one of the parties to the dispute necessarily the following two questions must be examined to understand the exact scope of the said subsection\n",
      "1 whether the property referred to in the subsection is any property of one of the parties to the dispute or should such property bear any relationship to the dispute\n",
      "2 whether the acquisition of the interest referred to should be anterior to the reference of the dispute to the co operative court or on acquisition made during the pendency of the litigation\n",
      "34 the answer to the first question to our mind is plain the property in which the 3rd party acquired interest must bear some relationship with the dispute pending before the tribunal to hold otherwise would be to enable the cooperative court to examine questions unconnected with the dispute pending before it and wholly unconnected with the affairs of the society an illogical result to be normally avoided unless compelled by the express language of the act\n",
      "35 coming to the second question learned counsel for the appellant argued that the intention of the legislature is to be gathered from the language of the subs 3a and the employment of the present perfect tense has acquired any interest must only lead to a conclusion that the legislature intended the cooperative court to deal with only the cases of acquisition of interest in the property during the pendency of the litigation before it on the other hand shri sundaram argued that there is no warrant for such an inference in the language of sub s 3a\n",
      "36 we are of the opinion that having regard to the language of section 94 subs 3a more specifically has acquired any interest the acquisition of the interest contemplated is only an acquisition made during the pendency of the dispute before the co operative court for the reason that such an acquisition of interest is qualified by the words in the property of a person who is a party to the dispute we hold so for another reason also\n",
      "37 to hold otherwise would lead to a situation where a dispute between an enumerated person and a 3rd party would become amenable to the jurisdiction of the cooperative court at the instance of the persons enumerated under s 91 but not at the instance of a 3rd party in view of the judgment of this court in 1991 1 scc 4691990 indlaw sc 513 an absurd situation ex facie violative of article 14 in as much as such a construction would lead to a situation that with reference to a dispute the affected parties are compelled to approach different fora for the adjudication of the same dispute depending upon the fact which party is seeking a relief such a construction being inconsistent with a constitutional mandate is impermissible\n",
      "38 for coming to the conclusion that the suits in question are not maintainable and the dispute could be examined exclusively by the cooperative court the high court proceeded on the basis that it is possible to challenge the resolution and the conveyance independently starting from such a premise the high court opined that challenge alone to the resolution without challenging the conveyance is possible but not viceversa the reason given by the high court for the same is as follows\n",
      "if court passes a decree or order setting aside the resolution of the general body the validity of the conveyance will not be intact but if a decree or order is made merely setting aside the conveyance the resolution of the general body will remain intact by the conveyance land owned by the society is transferred the society is a body corporate the person or persons who have signed the conveyance on behalf of the society derive the authority to do so from resolution of the general body if the resolution is set aside or is declared invalid the act of the person of executing the conveyance would become unauthorised such an order in relation to the validity of the general body resolution will impair the validity of the conveyance consequently if the resolution remains intact but the conveyance is set aside for some reason the society may be in a position to execute another conveyance pursuant to the resolution of the general body\n",
      "we do not propose to examine the correctness of the legal premise that the general body resolution and the conveyance could be segregated in a dispute such as one on the hand for the sake of argument we presume that it is possible for the plaintiffs appellants herein to challenge only the general body resolution we also presume that the conclusion arrived at by the high court that if the general body resolution is set aside the same will impair the validity of the conveyance even without an appropriate declaration by a competent judicial body we emphasise that we only presume so without examining to the said conclusion for the limited purpose if the resolution dated 6th december 2009 alone is challenged before the cooperative court in view of our conclusion recorded earlier the respondents 22 and 23 the beneficiaries of the resolution could not be made parties before the cooperative court\n",
      "in such a situation even if the cooperative court came to the conclusion that the resolution is illegal it would always be open for the respondents 22 and 23 to ignore such a determination as they are not parties to the proceedings and assert their title on the basis of the conveyance dated 7th december 2009 if any party such as the plaintiffs the appellants herein disputes the validity of the title conveyed thereunder necessarily such a dispute would have to be adjudicated by a competent court us 9 of the code of civil procedure wherein necessarily the question whether a valid title was conveyed in favour of respondents 22 and 23 by the society would arise for determination the legality of the resolution would still have to be gone into again therefore in our opinion the premise in which the high court commenced its enquiry itself is wrong\n",
      "39 for all the abovementioned reasons we are of the opinion that the conclusion of the high court that the suits in question are not maintainable on the ground that the dispute is amenable to the exclusive jurisdiction under s 91 of the act to the co operative court cannot be sustained and the same is required to be set aside\n",
      "40 that takes us to the next question raised in these appeals  whether the high court was right in going into the maintainability of the suits in question shri venugopal learned senior counsel appearing for some of the respondents submitted that in view of the provisions contained in section 9a of the code which was introduced by local amendment of the maharashtra legislature to the code by maharashtra act no65 of 1977 the course of action followed by the high court is not only justified but also the court is obliged to follow such a course of action section 9a reads as follows\n",
      "9a whereof the hearing of application relating to interim relief in a suit objection to jurisdiction is taken such issue to be decided by the court as a preliminary issue\n",
      "1 notwithstanding anything contained in this code or any other law for the time beiong in force if at the hearing of any application for granting or setting aside an order granting any interim relief whether by way of stay injunction appointment of a receiver or otherwise made in any suit an objection to the jurisdiction of the court to entertain such a suit is taken by any of the parties to the suit the court shall proceed to determine at the hearing of such application the issue as to the jurisdiction as a preliminary issue before granting or setting aside the order granting the interim relief any such application shall be heard and disposed of by the court as expeditiously as possible and shall not in any case be adjourned to the hearing of the suit\n",
      "2 notwithstanding anything contained ion subsection 1 at the hearing of any such application the court may grant such interim relief as it may consider necessary pending determination by it of the preliminary issue as to the jurisdiction\n",
      "the language of section 9a is selfexplanatory we accept the submission made by shri venugopal in toto\n",
      "41 coming to the question of the interim order in view of our conclusion that the suits in question are maintainable and having regard to the fact that the suits are to be tried by the high court in exercise of its original jurisdiction we do not propose to pass any interim order and leave it open to the high court to consider the applications filed by the plaintiffs for interim orders in accordance with law and pass appropriate orders the principles governing the grant of interim orders are too well settled and we need not expound the same once again\n",
      "however we would like to indicate that on the question of the existence of a prima facie case in favour of the plaintiffs the following factors are germane and require to be examined having regard to the content of the plaint we are of the opinion that the nature of the legal right the plaintiffs claim for seeking the relief such as the one sought in the suits necessarily depends upon the byelaws of the society the rights and obligations of the various classes of its members with respect to the property in dispute the high court may examine the above aspects before passing an appropriate interim order\n",
      "42 in view of the above we also deem it proper to direct all the parties to maintain status quo as on today for a period of two weeks to enable the bombay high court to examine the applications of the plaintiffs for interim orders and pass appropriate orders in accordance with law\n",

      "2  a writ petition was filed by the respondent herein inter alia praying for his regularization a learned single judge of the lucknow bench of the allahabad high court on the day of preliminary hearing while issuing rule passed the following order\n",
      "in the meantime the opposite parties no3 to 5 shall examine the petitioners claim for regularization under the regularization rules 2001 and pass appropriate orders however his claim shall not be rejected on the ground of the post being not available supernumerary posts have to be created to comply with the provisions of the regularization rules and kept alive until regular posts fall vacant till a decision is taken the petitioner shall be paid wages equivalent to the minimum of pay scale admissible to a mate working in the department with effect from 1st january 2004\n",
      "3  a special appeal filed therein against but the same was barred by limitation the division bench inter alia on the said premise refused to interfere with the order passed by the learned single judge stating\n",
      "in these circumstances the appeal court should not interfere but leave the matter to be decided by the honble single judge on a final basis the appeal is thus dismissed on merits and also on the ground of delay which we are not minded to condone although this is illogical we thought it better to make our minds known\n",
      "4  a bare perusal of the impugned order should show that the learned single judge for all intent and purport had allowed the writ petition on the very first day which in our opinion was not justified it is now wellsettled that a relief which can be granted only at the final hearing of the matter should not ordinarily be granted by way of an interim order it is also doubtful as to whether the impugned directions could have been issued even at the final hearing of the matter which would amount to creation of supernumerary post in purported compliance of the regularisation rules\n",

      "6  furthermore the state of uttar pradesh must have made rules in terms of the proviso appended to article 309 of the constitution of india providing for the mode and manner in which recruitments are to be made such rules have statutory force\n",
      "7  the learned counsel for the respondents however drew our attention to paragraphs 62 of umadevi 2006 indlaw sc 125 supra which reads as under\n",
      "one aspect needs to be clarified there may be cases where irregular appointments not illegal appointments as explained in sv narayanappa rn nanjundappa and bn nagarajan and referred to in para 15 above of duly qualified persons of duly qualified persons in duly sanctioned vacant posts might have been made and the employees have continued to work for ten years or more but without the intervention of orders of the courts or of tribunals the question of regularization of the services of such employees may have to be considered on merits in the light of the principles settled by this court in the cases above referred to and in the light of this judgment in that context the union of india the state governments and their instrumentalities should take steps to regularize as one time measure the services of said irregularly appointed who have worked for ten years and more in duly sanctioned post but not under cover of orders of the courts or of tribunals and should further ensure that regular recruitments are undertaken to fill that vacant sanctioned posts that required to be filled up in cases where temporary employees or daily wagers are being now employed the process must be set in motion within six months from this date we also clarify that regularization if any already made but not subjudice need not be reopened based on this judgment but there should be no further byepassing of the constitutional requirement and regularizing or making permanent those not duly appointed as per the constitutional scheme\n",
      "8  the observations made in the said paragraph must be read in the light of the observations made in paragraphs 15 and 16 of the judgment the constitution bench referred to the decisions of this court in state of mysore vs sv narayanappa 1967 1 scr 128 1966 indlaw sc 70 rn nanjundappa vs t thimmiah 1972 1 scc 409 1971 indlaw sc 281 and bn nagarajan vs state of karnataka 1979 4 scc 507 1979 indlaw sc 600 bn nagarajan is a decision rendered by a three judge bench of this court in which it has clearly been held that the regularisation does not mean permanence a distinction has clearly been made in those decisions between irregularity and illegality an appointment which was made throwing all constitutional obligations and statutory rules to winds would render the same illegal whereas irregularity pre supposes substantial compliance of the rules\n",

      "10 the contention of the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents that the appointments were irregular and not illegal cannot be accepted for more than one reason they were appointed only on the basis of their applications the recruitment rules were not followed even the selection committee had not been properly constituted in view of the ban on employment no recruitment was permissible in law the reservation policy adopted by the appellant had not been maintained even cases of minorities had not been given due consideration\n",
      "11  the constitution bench thought of directing regularization of the services only of those employees whose appointments were irregular as explained in state of mysore vs sv narayanappa 1966 indlaw sc 70 rn narayandappa vs t thimmiah 1971 indlaw sc 281 and bn nagarajan vs state of karnataka 1979 indlaw sc 600 wherein this court observed\n",
      "in bn nagarajan v state of karnataka 1979 indlaw sc 600 this court clearly held that the words regular or regularization do not connote permanence and cannot be construed so as to convey an idea of the nature of tenure of appointments they are terms calculated to condone any procedural irregularities and are meant to cure only such defects as are attributable to methodology followed in making the appointments\n",

      "13  it is not the case of the respondents that they were recruited in terms of the provisions of the recruitment rules framed under the proviso appended to article 309 of the constitution of india in that view of the matter ex facie their appointments were illegal we however must observe that we have not been taken through the purport and import or the various provisions of the pwd rules to which we have made reference here to before but in any event the question of regularisation of the employees by reason of any policy decision adopted by the state is impermissible in law the learned division bench could have dismissed the special appeal filed by the appellant on the ground of delay it did not do so it purported to uphold the order of the learned single judge even on merits\n",

      "2   for the year 199596 there were 33 vacancies and advertisements were issued therefor respondent herein was one of the applicants for the said post the selection committee prepared a select list the respondents name figured at serial no10 of the said list out of 33 vacancies 19 posts were to be filled up by teachers physical education and 14 posts were meant for teachers gradeiii out of 19 posts of teachers physical education 9 posts were for general category candidates 5 posts were reserved for obc candidates 2 posts for scheduled castes candidate and one post for scheduled tribes candidate one post was to be filled on the vacancies arising out of appointment on compassionate grounds the date of joining was fixed on 12041996 the candidate placed at serial no8 in the merit list did not join the vacant post was said to have been carried forward to 199697 respondent had also applied for the post of teacher physical education in the said year but he was been placed at serial no23 in the merit list and thus was not found fit to be appointed in 199697 also he filed a writ petition before the rajasthan high court on the premise that the validity of the merit list had expired a learned single judge of the said high court opined that he had no legal right to be appointed stating \n",
      "since respondent prepares a new panel every year and it will remain effective prior to the end of that session ie till march hence after the expiry of duration of panel the candidates included in that panel will not have remained any legal right to be appointed in the present case also the duration of the panel has been expired and appointments have already been made in accordance with the same\n",
      "3   an intracourt appeal was preferred thereagainst a division bench of the high court however reversed the said decision without adverting to the question as to whether the select list has remained valid or not it was held \n",
      "taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case the defence taken that till 31st of march 1996 there was no post vacant in the department is difficult to accept the petitioner did all whatever he could have done at the relevant time to protect his right of consideration for appointment the ground on which the writ petition was dismissed is not tenable\n",
      "as a result of the aforesaid discussion this appeal succeeds and the same is allowed the order dated 191997 of the learned single judge in sb civil writ petition no45991996 impugned in this appeal is quashed and set aside the writ petition is allowed and declared post of teacher physical education fallen vacant due to non joining of the appointed candidate stood at serial no8 of the merit list the respondents are directed to give appointment to the petitioner on the post of teacher physical education within a period of one month from the date of receipt of the copy of this judgment the appointment shall relate back to the date on which the appointment candidate stood at serial no9 of the merit list ought to have joined the post\n",
      "the petitioner appellant shall not be entitled for the actual monetary benefits for the intervening period ie the date on which he would have joined the service and the date of his actual joining however this period shall be counted for other service and retrial benefits\n",
      "4   the state is thus in appeal before us mr aruneshwar gupta additional advocate general appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that the respondent did not have any legal right to be appointed particularly when the validity of a merit list is confined only to one year\n",
      "5   mr aishwarya bhati learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent on the other hand urged that as the candidates were to join their posts on 1241996 the state itself did not adhere to the period during which of the vacancies were required to be filled up according to the learned counsel respondent has already joined his services\n",
      "6  learned counsel submitted that rule 93 does not fix the period of validity of the panel and in that view of the matter the respondent who was on the wait list should have been appointed as one of the selected candidates could not join\n",
      "7   recruitment for teachers in the state of rajasthan is admittedly governed by the statutory rules all recruitments therefore are required to be made in terms thereof although rule 93 of the rules does not specifically provide for the period for which the merit list shall remain valid but the intent of the legislature is absolutely clear as vacancies have to be determined only once in a year vacancies which arose in the subsequent years could be filled up from the select list prepared in the previous year and not in other manner even otherwise in absence of any rule ordinary period of validity of select list should be one year in state of bihar  ors v amrendra kumar mishra 2006 9 scale 549 2006 indlaw sc 524 this court opined \n",
      "in the aforementioned situation in our opinion he did not have any legal right to be appointed life of a panel it is well known remains valid for a year once it lapses unless an appropriate order is issued by the state no appointment can be made out of the said panel\n",
      "it was further held\n",
      " the decision noticed hereinbefore is authorities for the proposition that even the waitlist must be acted upon having regard to the terms of the advertisement and in any event cannot remain operative beyond the prescribed period\n",
      "8   the learned single judge of the high court was therefore correct in holding that the second respondent has no legal right to be appointed it is well settled principle of law that even selected candidates do not have legal right in this behalf see shankarasan dash v union of india  1991 2 scr 567 1991 indlaw sc 188 asha kaul mrs and another v state of jammu and kashmir and others 1993 2 scc 577 1992 indlaw sc 967 in k jayamohan v state of kerala and another 1997 5 scc 170 1997 indlaw sc 894 this court held\n",
      "it is settled legal position that merely because a candidate is selected and kept in the waiting list he does not acquire any absolute right to appointment it is open to the government to make the appointment or not even if there is any vacancy it is not incumbent upon the government to fill up the same but the appointing authority must give reasonable explanation for non appointment equally the public service commissionrecruitment agency shall prepare waiting list only to the extent of anticipated vacancies\n",
      "in view of the above settled legal position no error is found in the judgment of the high court warranting interference see also munna roy v union of india and others 2000 9 scc 2832000 indlaw sc 3038 in all india sc  st employees association and another v a arthur jeen and others 2001 6 scc 380 2001 indlaw sc 20097 it was opined\n",
      "merely because the names of the candidates were included in the panel indicating their provisional selection they did not acquire any indefeasible right for appointment even against the existing vacancies and the state is under no legal duty to fill up all or any of the vacancies as laid down by the constitution bench of this court after referring to earlier cases in shankarsan dash vs union of india para of the said judgment reads thus \n",
      "it is not correct to say that if a number of vacancies are notified for appointment and adequate number of candidates are found fit the successful candidates acquire an indefeasible right to be appointed which cannot be legitimately denied ordinarily the notification merely amounts to an invitation to qualified candidates to apply for recruitment and on their selection they do not acquire any right to the post unless the relevant recruitment rules so indicate the state is under no legal duty to fill up all or any of the vacancies however it does not mean that the state has the licence of acting in an arbitrary manner the decision not to fill up the vacancies has to be taken bona fide for appropriate reasons and if the vacancies or any of them are filled up the state is bound to respect the comparative merit of the candidates as reflected at the recruitment test and no discrimination can be permitted this correct position has been consistently followed by this court and we do not find any discordant note in the decisions in state of haryana vs subhash chander marwaha 1973 indlaw sc 150 neelima shangla vs state of haryana 1986 indlaw sc 194 or jatendra kumar vs state of punjab\n",
      "9  the principles laid down in the aforementioned cases have been followed by this court in food corporation of india and others v bhanu lodh and others 2005 3 scc 618 2005 indlaw sc 165 stating\n",
      "merely because vacancies are notified the state is not obliged to fill up all the vacancies unless there is some provision to the contrary in the applicable rules however there is no doubt that the decision not to fill up the vacancies has to be taken bona fide and must pass the test of reasonableness so as not to fail on the touchstone of article 14 of the constitution again if the vacancies are proposed to be filled then the state is obliged to fill them in accordance with merit from the list of the selected candidates whether to fill up or not to fill up a post is a policy decision and unless it is infected with the vice of arbitrariness there is no scope for interference in judicial review\n",
      "10 in pitta naveen kumar and others v raja narasaiah zangiti and others 2006 10 scc 261 2006 indlaw sc 567 this court observed \n",
      "the legal position obtaining in this behalf is not in dispute a candidate does not have any legal right to be appointed he in terms of article 16 of the constitution of india has only a right to be considered there for consideration of the case of an individual candidate although ordinarily is required to be made in terms of the extant rules but strict adherence thereto would be necessary in a case where the rules operate only to the disadvantage of the candidates concerned and not otherwise\n",
      "furthermore the division bench was not at all justified in directing grant of service benefits to the respondent from the date on which the appointed candidate at serial no9 in the merit list ought to have joined the post such a direction in our opinion is wholly unwarranted\n",
      "11  we however cannot set aside the impugned judgment because of the fact that the state has appointed the respondent during the pendency of this special leave petition we may furthermore notice that even a stay of further proceedings in the contempt petition has been passed by this court by an order dated 16052007\n",
      "12  we therefore are of the opinion that it will not be proper for this court now at this juncture to set aside the said appointment as the appointment granted in favour of the respondent by the state was not by reason of his merit in the select list but by reason of the orders of the high court we therefore in exercise of our jurisdiction under article 142 of the constitution of india and keeping in view the fact that the matter is pending for a long time are of the opinion that a direction should be issued that the appointment of the respondent may be directed to be continued as if he was appointed on and from the date he joined the service\n",
      "13  the appeal is allowed to the afore mentioned extent parties are left to bear their own costs\n",

      "appeal crl 924 of 2001\n",
      "the judgment was delivered by  arijit pasayat j\n",
      "1   the appellants were convicted for offences punishable us 302 read with s 34 of the indian penal code 1860 in short the ipc and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment by the trial court they did not get any relief from the allahabad high court which by the impugned judgment upheld the conviction and sentence\n",
      "the prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows\n",
      "2   after death of durga singh each of his three sons became owner of about 30 bighas of land one of them khetrapal hereinafter referred to as the deceased was issueless earlier khetrapal used to reside with accused janak singh and the latter used to cultivate the land which fell to share of khetrapal also but about a year or 112 years prior to the incident in question khetrapal started living with bhuri singh pw1 the land of khetrapal singh which was earlier being cultivated by janak singh came into the possession of bhuri singh this was to the disliking of accused janak singh khetrapal wanted to execute a will in favour of bhuri singh on the date of incident ie 16101979 at about 10 am khetrapal along with bhuri singh pw1 and surjeet singh pw7 were proceeding to etmadpur tehsil for execution of the will and when they reached near the pit the accused janak singh armed with a country made pistol and accused sarvesh with a gun arrived there and enquired from khetrapal whether he was going to execute a will in favour of bhuri singh and when khetrapal replied in affirmative janak singh told that they would not allow him to do so\n",
      "3  thereafter both accused janak singh and sarvesh fired upon khetrapal who fell down on the ground on receiving gunshot injuries when bhuri singh and surjeet singh pw7 tried to save khetrapal they were also fired upon by the accused persons and they also sustained fire arm injuries when deceased khetrapal fell down on the ground accused sarvesh fired at khetrapal from his gun resulting in khetrapals instantaneous death bhuri singh pw1 then lodged the first information report which was ascribed by ram singh at police station etmadpur on the same day at 130 pm the distance of police station being 4 miles from the place of occurrence on the basis of the written report chik first information report was prepared by the head moharrir bihari ji yadav and the case was registered in the general diary the station officer mahabir singh took up investigation and interrogated bhuri singh and surjeet singh at the police station itself and sent both of them to hospital for medical examination with constable lajja ram the investigation was undertaken and on completion thereof charge sheet was placed and accused persons faced trial to substantiate its accusations the prosecution examined 8 witnesses though pws 1 and 7 were stated to be eyewitnesses who had sustained injuries during the occurrence pw7 resiled from the statement given during investigation so the prosecution case rested on the testimony of pw1 the injured eyewitness the trial court found that his evidence was credible and cogent and conviction was made as noted above\n",
      "4   the main stand of the accused persons before the high court was that evidence of pw1 did not inspire confidence as it was at a great variance with the medical evidence therefore he being an interested person who would be beneficiary if the accused persons are convicted without corroboration his evidence should not be acted upon the specific plea regarding the variation of pw1s evidence visavis medical evidence was with reference to distance according to the doctor the gun shot which caused injury was fired from a distance of about 34 ft according to pw 1 the distance was about 2025 ft the trial court noticed that pw1 was a person who even did not know how to sign and gave thumb impression his perception of distance being that of a layman no undue importance should be attached to the estimated distance similar plea raised before the high court also did not find acceptance\n",
      "5   in support of the appeal mr ur lalit learned senior counsel submitted that pw1s evidence is not credible and cogent the high court should not have tried to lightly brush aside the inconsistency clearly noticeable between his evidence and that of the doctor who stated that the injuries found in the body of the deceased could be caused if gun shot was done from a short distance further there was no effort made to seize the gun allegedly used by a2 that would have shown whether the injuries sustained could have been caused by the gun allegedly used by the accused persons there was no injury on the backside and the only injury noticed on pw1 was near the eyebrow it was submitted that s 34 ipc has no application\n",
      "6   in response learned counsel for the state supported the judgments and submitted that concurrent findings recorded by the trial court and the high court on analysing the evidence should not be disturbed\n",
      "7   we shall first deal with the plea regarding the alleged inconsistency between the eyewitness version and the medical evidence as to the distance from which the gun was fired where direct evidence of the eyewitness is that the accused committed the murder by firing a gun some inconsistency relating to distance based on medical opinion offered would be of no significance whatsoever see karnail singh and others v the state of punjab air 1971 sc 2119 1971 indlaw sc 621 the view in karnail singhs case 1971 indlaw sc 621 supra was also reiterated in state of uttar pradesh v sughar singh and others air 1978 sc 191 1977 indlaw sc 291\n",
      "8  s 34 has been enacted on the principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act the section is only a rule of evidence and does not create a substantive offence the distinctive feature of the section is the element of participation in action the liability of one person for an offence committed by another in the course of criminal act perpetrated by several persons arises under s 34 if such criminal act is done in furtherance of a common intention of the persons who join in committing the crime direct proof of common intention is seldom available and therefore such intention can only be inferred from the circumstances appearing from the proved facts of the case and the proved circumstances in order to bring home the charge of common intention the prosecution has to establish by evidence whether direct or circumstantial that there was plan or meeting of mind of all the accused persons to commit the offence for which they are charged with the aid of section 34 be it prearranged or on the spur of moment but it must necessarily be before the commission of the crime\n",
      "9  the true contents of the section is that if two or more persons intentionally do an act jointly the position in law is just the same as if each of them has done it individually by himself as observed in ashok kumar v state of punjab air 1977 sc 109 1976 indlaw sc 468 the existence of a common intention amongst the participants in a crime is the essential element for application of this section it is not necessary that the acts of the several persons charged with commission of an offence jointly must be the same or identically similar the acts may be different in character but must have been actuated by one and the same common intention in order to attract the provision\n",
      "10   as it originally stood the s 34 was in the following terms\n",
      "when a criminal act is done by several persons each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act was done by him alone in 1870 it was amended by the insertion of the words in furtherance of the common intention of all after the word persons and before the word each so as to make the object of s 34 clear this position was noted in mahbub shah v emperor air 1945 privy council 118 1945 indlaw pc 14\n",
      "11  the section does not say the common intention of all nor does it say and intention common to all under the provisions of s 34 the essence of the liability is to be found in the existence of a common intention animating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such intention as a result of the application of principles enunciated in section 34 when an accused is convicted us 302 read with section 34 in law it means that the accused is liable for the act which caused death of the deceased in the same manner as if it was done by him alone the provision is intended to meet a case in which it may be difficult to distinguish between acts of individual members of a party who act in furtherance of the common intention of all or to prove exactly what part was taken by each of them as was observed in ch pulla reddy and ors v state of andhra pradesh air 1993 sc 1899 1993 indlaw sc 1030 s 34 is applicable even if no injury has been caused by the particular accused himself for applying s 34 it is not necessary to show some overt act on the part of the accused the legality of conviction by applying s 34 ipc in the absence of such charge was examined in several cases in willie william slaney v state of madhya pradesh air 1956 sc 116 1955 indlaw sc 80 it was held as follows\n",
      "sections 34 114 and 149 of the indian penal code provide for criminal liability viewed from different angles as regards actual participants accessories and men actuated by a common object or a common intention and the charge is a rolled up one involving the direct liability and the constructive liability without specifying who are directly liable and who are sought to be made constructively liable in such a situation the absence of a charge under one or other of the various heads of criminal liability for the offence cannot be said to be fatal by itself and before a conviction for the substantive offence without a charge can be set aside prejudice will have to be made out in most of the cases of this kind evidence is normally given from the outset as to who was primarily responsible for the act which brought about the offence and such evidence is of course relevant\n",
      "12  the above position was reiterated in dhanna etc v state of madhya pradesh air 1996 sc 2478 1996 indlaw sc 2240\n",
      "13  s 34 ipc has clear application to the facts of the case and seems to have been rightly and properly applied also\n",
      "14  though the evidence of pw1 was assailed on the ground that he is the beneficiary if accused persons are convicted we find he had sustained injuries his evidence was carefully analysed by the courts below and we do not find any noticeable discrepancy in his evidence to discard it\n",
      "15  the judgments of the trial court and the high court are wellreasoned with conclusions and finding recorded therein supported by ample concrete and relevant evidence and consequently the conviction suffers from no infirmity to warrant any interference it is not a fit case where jurisdiction uart 136 of the constitution of india needs to be exercised the appeal is dismissed the accused persons who are on bail are directed to surrender to custody forthwith to serve remainder of sentence\n",

      "considering the contentions raised by learned counsel for the petitioner and the evidence on record the impugned order passed by special judge and confirmed by the high court with regard to the conviction of the petitioner us 7 of the prevention of corruption act cannot be assailed in any manner hence with regard to that part of the judgment this petition is dismissed however with regard to the conviction of the petitioner us 131d issue notice returnable on 9 january 2002\n",
      "3  thereafter the matter was directed to be placed on a non miscellaneous day for final hearing\n",
      "4  the learned senior counsel mr anand appearing on behalf of appellant submitted that the judgment and order passed by the high court confirming the conviction of the appellant us 131di of the act is on the face of it illegal and erroneous he submitted that for convicting the appellant for the offence us 131d the prosecution must establish that by corrupt and illegal means accused has obtained for himself or for any other person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage he submitted that in the present case there is no evidence on record that appellant obtained any amount by corrupt or illegal means\n",
      "5  in our view mere acceptance of money without there being any other evidence would not be sufficient for convicting the accused us 131di s 131d is as under\n",

      "iiiwhile holding office as a public servant obtains for any person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage without any public interest\n",
      "6  in ss 7 and 131a and b of the act the legislature has specifically used the words accepts or obtains as against this there is departure in the language used in cl 1d of s 13 and it has omitted the word accepts and has emphasized the word obtains further the ingredient of subcl i is that by corrupt or illegal means a public servant obtains any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage under clause ii he obtains such thing by abusing his position as public servant and subcl iii contemplates that while holding office as the public servant he obtains for any person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage without any public interest therefore for convicting the person us 131d there must be evidence on record that accused obtained for himself or for any other person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage by either corrupt or illegal means or by abusing his position as a public servant or he obtained for any person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage without any public interest\n",
      "7  this court interpreted similar provisions under the prevention of corruption act 1947 in ram krishan and another v the state of delhi 1956 scr 183 1956 indlaw sc 134 in the said case the court dealt with similar cl d of subs 1 of s 5 and held that there must be proof that the public servant adopted corrupt or illegal means and thereby obtained for himself or for any other person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage the court observed\n",
      "in one sense this is no doubt true but it does not follow that there is no overlapping of offences we have primarily to look at the language employed and give effect to it one class of cases might arise when corrupt or illegal means are adopted or pursued by the public servant to gain for himself a pecuniary advantage the word obtains on which much stress was laid does not eliminate the idea of acceptance of what is given or offered to be given though it connotes also an element of effort on the part of the receiver one may accept money that is offered or solicit payment of a bribe or extort the bribe by threat or coercion in each case he obtains a pecuniary advantage by abusing his position as a public servant\n",
      "the court further observed that\n",
      "it is enough if by abusing his position as a public servant a man obtains for himself any pecuniary advantage entirely irrespective of motive or reward for showing favour or disfavour\n",
      "8  similarly in mw mohiuddin v state of maharashtra 1995 3 scc 567 1995 indlaw sc 1606 the court dealt with s 131di and ii and after referring to the decision quoted above as well as dictionary meaning of word obtains observedwhether there was an acceptance of what is given as a bribe and whether there was an effort on the part of the receiver to obtain the pecuniary advantage by way of acceptance of the bribe depends on the facts and circumstances of each case in that case the court held that it was proved that accused made a demand and also got the affirmation from the complainant that he had brought the demanded money and at his instance the complainant wrapped the money in the handkerchief given by the accused and placed the same on the bag which was brought by the accused and as asked by him these steps have been taken into consideration in arriving at the conclusion that the accused had in fact obtained the pecuniary advantage namely that he received the illegal gratification  therefore the court upheld the conviction us 131d lastly in ck damodaran nair v govt of india 1997 9 scc 477 1997 indlaw sc 2597 this court considered the word obtain used in s 51d and held as under\n",
      "12 the position will however be different so far as an offence under s 51d read with s 52 of the act is concerned for such an offence prosecution has to prove that the accused obtained the valuable thing or pecuniary advantage by corrupt or illegal means or by otherwise abusing his position as a public servant and that too without the aid of the statutory presumption us 41 of the act as it is available only in respect of offences under s 51a and band not under s 51c d or e of the act obtain means to secure or gain something as the result of request or effort shorter oxford dictionary in case of obtainment the initiative vests in the person who receives and in that context a demand or request from him will be a primary requisite for an offence under s 51d of the act unlike an offence us 161 ipc which as noticed above can be established by proof of either acceptance or obtainment\n",
      "9  same is the position of statutory presumption us 20 of the act and is available for the offence punishable us 7 or s 11 or cl a or cl b of subs 1 of s 13 and not for cl d of subs 1 of s 13\n",
      "10  in the background of aforesaid settled legal position we would now refer to the relevant part of the evidence before the trial court it was submitted by the learned app that complainant has not supported the prosecution case on main ingredients of demand and acceptance and was treated hostile in crossexamination also he has not supported the prosecution version on demand or acceptance of the amount the trial court has also observed that the complainant deliberately does not support on the points of demand and acceptance however the court relied upon the evidence of panch shailesh devshankar pandya pw2 we were taken through the evidence of pw2 pandya and from his evidence it is difficult to find out any statement made by him that accused demanded any amount from the complainant the relevant part of the evidence of this witness suggests that when the prosecution party went at the police chowki accused asked the complainant as to why he had come there at that time to that complainant replied that he was waiting since one oclock and that he has brought one witness to be examined accused informed him to come in the evening as his writer was not present when the accused started to go towards toilet the complainant followed him and he gave something from his pocket to the accused who took the same and put that in his pocket from this evidence it cannot be inferred that accused demanded any amount from the complainant or that he had obtained the same it is apparent that the trial court and the high court misread the evidence of pw2 and held that there was demand by the accused and the amount was paid to him by the complainant it was unreasonable to hold that accused demanded money from the complainant complainant denied the said story and pw2 had not stated so\n",
      "11  in this view of the matter this appeal is partly allowed impugned judgment and order passed by the high court confirming the order passed by the special judge city civil court ahmedabad convicting the appellant for the offence punishable us 131di is set aside and the appellant is acquitted for the same\n",

      "2 the respondent was serving the railways as an assistant traffic superintendent prior to december 2 1957 his services were terminated by serving on him one months notice under rule 148 contained in the indian railways establishment code the respondent filed an appeal to the general manager but he was informed by means of a letter dated february 3 1959 that no appeal was competent in june 1959 he was offered reemployment as a statistical inspector in the scale of rs 200 to rs 300 plus the usual allowances on terms and conditions applicable to temporary employees it appears that the respondent accepted the offer and was appointed to the post\n",
      "3 he was finally informed by means of a letter dated december 31 1959 that his representation had been considered by the railway board relating to the termination of his services as assistant traffic superintendent but the same had been rejected on december 5 1963 this court decided by majority in moti ram deka etc v general manager nef railways etc 1964 5 scr 683 1963 indlaw sc 215 that rules 148 3 and 1493 of the indian railway establishment code were invalid the respondent made a representation thereafter in 1964 to the general manager to reconsider the case of the termination of his services in the light of the law declared by this court\n",
      "4 the general manager sent a reply dated june 3 1964 saying that the question of the respondents reinstatement could not be considered as it was not covered by limits of law ie it does not fail within a period of six years from the date of your termination of service this was followed by another letter dated december 7 1964 in which it was stated\n",
      "it has now been clarified by the railway board that the claim for reinstatement of the ex employees whose services were terminated in terms of rule 148 149 within a period of six years prior to 51263 the date of the supreme courts judgment and whose representation is still pending is only to be considered since your services were terminated on 21257 which is more than six years counting backwards from 51263 it is regretted that your request for reinstatement cannot be acceded to\n",
      "5 thereupon the respondent filed a petition under art 226 of the constitution in the high court as stated before the petition was allowed principally on the ground that the railway authorities were not legally justified in making a distinction between officers whose services had been terminated within six years prior to the judgment of this court in moti ram dekas 1964 5 scr 683 1963 indlaw sc 215 case and the cases of those whose services had been terminated earlier as pointed out in the judgment of the high court that respondents services were terminated on december 2 1957 he was behind time by 3 days only it was found that such an artificial demarcation between the two kinds of cases was hit by art 14 of the constitution the other point that the respondent had accepted reemployment and must be deemed to have waived his rights to reinstatement to his original office was also repelled\n",
      "6 in moti ram dekas 1964 5 scr 683 1963 indlaw sc 215 case this court held that the termination of the services of a permanent servant authorised by rules 1483 and 1493 of the railway establishment code was inconsistent with the provisions of art 311 2 of the constitution the termination of the services of a permanent servant authorised by those rules was no more and no less than removal from service and art 3112 was at once attracted in view of the law laid down by this court the termination of the services of the respondent in december 1957 was wholly void and illegal\n",
      "7 the railway authorities recognised as indeed they were bound to do the implications and effect of the judgment of this court but created a wholly illegal and artificial distinction by saying that only those employees whose services were terminated in terms rule 148 within a period of six years prior to december 5 1963 and whose representations were pending were to be considered for reinstatement whereas the employees like the respondent whose services had been terminated on a date which was more than six years counting backward from december 5 1963 would not be reinstated\n",
      "8 the fixing of the period of six years was on the face of it arbitrary and no valid or reasonable explanation has been given as to why this limit was fixed if the termination of service of an employee in terms of rule 148 was wholly illegal and void and was violative of art 311 2 of the constitution his reinstatement should have followed as a matter of course the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that the railway authorities would have found lot of difficulty and inconvenience in reinstating employees without taking into consideration the period which had elapsed is devoid of any merit and cannot be accepted\n",

      "2  there were three accused hikayat kahar shanti devi and nanhu kahar the alleged occurrence took place at about noon on september 22 1964 at a field in village bikrampur police station marhowra district chapra in bihar nagendra prasad singh was a cosharer landlord of the village and he was in possession of 27 kathas prior to and also subsequent to the vesting of the zamindari in the state of bihar nagendra singh had grown maize and other crops in an area of 6 kathas in the northern portion of the 27 kathas on the crucial date when nagendra singh along with his labourers went to the plot his brother rajendra singh also came there harvesting of maize was going on the accused tuned up hikayat and his wife shanti devi were armed with lathis nanhu was armed with a sword hikayat ordered assault and inflicted a lathi blow on the abdomen of nagendra singh the blow with sword was aimed by nanhu kahar at the head of nagendra singh nagendra singh warded off the blow with the help of his hand his hand was cut\n",
      "3 several other sword blows were inflicted and nagendra singh fell down and became unconscious his brother rajendra singh went to his rescue he was given some lathi blows by hikayat and his wife and blows with sword by nanhu kahar nagendra singh and rajendra singh were taken to the dispensary finding the condition of nagendra singh serious a dying declaration was recorded nagendra singh was sent to patna medical college hospital\n",
      "4  the accused were after investigation charged with offence under sections 307 37109 326 323 and 34 of the indian penal code\n",
      "5  the defence was that the land was in possession of the accused from long before the date of occurrence and the crops were sown by the accused nagendra singh and his brother rajendra singh came to the field along with nine other persons because of enmity on protest being raised by hikayat and nanhu assault was ordered by nagendra singh there was infliction of blow on the head of hikayat by rajendra singh another blow was inflicted upon hikayat by one rameshwar singh hikayat fled away hikayat was on old person his wife shanti was about 60 years old the house of hikayat was set on fire and three of his houses were burnt\n",

      "8 the high court found that it was not possible on the materials on record to come to a definite conclusion that the land was actually in possession of nagendra singh or that he had grown the maize crop therefore the high court held that the accused had a right of private defence when they found that their maize crop was being cut away\n",
      "9  in that view of the matter the only question is whether the right of private defence was exceeded the injuries sustained by the accused were minor injuries there was nothing to show that infliction of serious injuries on nagendra singh and rajendra singh was necessary in defence of property of defence of person there was evidence of nagendra singh himself that some of the sword blows were inflicted on him even after he fell down on getting the blows that was not challenged in crossexamination\n",

      "ca no 2066 of 1972 arising as an appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dt 31 january 1962 of the bombay high court in special civil application no 188 of 1972\n",
      "the judgment was delivered by bhagwati j\n",
      "1  the appellant is a law graduate having obtained llb degree from the university of bombay in october 1949 he started practice as pleader at jamkhandi in bijapur district and after practising for over nine years he applied for the post of civil judge junior division and judicial magistrate in the bombay judicial service class ii he was interviewed by the bombay public service commission and on being selected on the basis of merit he was appointed as civil judge junior division and judicial magistrate by an order of the government of maharashtra dated october 31 1960 the appointment was initially on probation for a period of two years and it was provided that after the period of probation was over his service would be liable to be terminated on one months notice so long as his appointment was temporary pursuant to the order of appointment the appellant worked as civil judge junior division and judicial magistrate and after watching his performance during the period of probation the government of maharashtra by a resolution dated april 19 1963 directed that he should be treated as having satisfactorily completed his probationary period from december 6 1962 afternoon and thereafter he should continue on an officiating basis as civil judge junior division and judicial magistrate the appellant accordingly continued to officiate as civil judge junior division and judicial magistrate it appears that a substantive vacancy in a permanent post of civil judge junior division and judicial magistrate arose sometime in 1968 in which the appellant could have been confirmed but the government of maharashtra instead of confirming him in that post passed an order dated december 15 1971 terminating his service with effect from february 1 1972 the first respondent who is secretary to the government of maharashtra law and judiciary department by a letter of the same date intimated to the appellant that his appointment being still temporary his service as liable to be terminated on one months notice and the government had accordingly decided to terminate his service with effect from february 1 1972 and enclosed a copy of the order of termination the appellant thereupon filed a petition in the high court of bombay uart 226 of the constitution challenging the validity of the order of termination\n",
      "2  there were three grounds on which the order of termination was assailed as invalid in the petition the first ground rested on rule 42iv of the bombay judicial service recruitment rules 1956 that rule provided that unless otherwise expressly directed every person appointed as civil judge junior division and judicial magistrate shall be on probation for a period of two years and on the expiration of such period he may be confirmed if a there is a vacancy and b his work is found satisfactory the argument of the appellant was that on a proper construction of this rule every civil judge junior division and judicial magistrate appointed on probation for a period of two years was entitled to be confirmed if on the expiration of such period of probation his work was found satisfactory and there was a vacancy in which he could be confirmed here in the present case said the appellant the government resolution dated april 19 1963 showed that on the expiration of the period of probation his work was found satisfactory and sometime in 1968 a vacancy did arise in which he could be confirmed and therefore under this rule he was entitled to be confirmed in such vacancy and he had a right to the post of civil judge junior division and judicial magistrate the government could not take away this right to the post by terminating the service of the appellant in the manner it did the termination of the service of the appellant was in the circumstances tantamount to dismissal and since the procedural requirement of art 3112 was admittedly not complied with by the government before passing the order of termination it was void and inoperative\n",
      "3 the second ground of challenge was that in the circumstances in which the order of termination was passed by the government it was not an order of termination simpliciter but it was by way of punishment and it could not be passed without complying with the procedural requirement of art 3112 lastly it was urged  and that was the third ground of challenge  that the order of termination was in any event violative of arts 14 and 16 of the constitution since civil judge junior division and judicial magistrate junior to the appellant were retained in service while the service of the appellant was terminated these were the three main grounds taken in the petition for challenging the validity of the order of termination\n",
      "4  when the petition came up for admission before a division bench of the high court the division bench summarily rejected it without even issuing a notice to the respondents the division bench however gave liberty to the appellant to file a suit for vindicating his rights the appellant being aggrieved by the summary rejection of his petition applied to the high court for leave to appeal to this court but the application was refused hence the appellant preferred the present appeal by special leave obtained from this court\n",
      "5  we do not think the high court was right in rejecting the petition of the appellant in limine the grounds of challenge taken by the appellant in the petition could not be said to be frivolous so as to merit summary rejection they did require consideration and particularly the first ground raised an issue of some importance depending on the true construction of rule 42iv of the bombay judicial service recruitment rules 1956 the high court ought therefore to have admitted the petition and issued a rule so that the grounds of challenge set out in the petition could be examined on merits no disputed questions of fact appeared to arise in the petition and in any event until a return was filed by the respondents it could not be said whether the controversy between the parties would involve any disputed questions of fact there was therefore no point in refusing to entertain the petition on merits and referring the appellant to a suit we must in the circumstances set aside the order of summary rejection passed by the high court and remand the petition to the high court with a direction to admit it and to issue a rule to the respondents\n",
      "6  we accordingly allow the appeal set aside the order passed by the high court summarily rejecting the petition and remand the petition to the high court with a direction that the petition shall be admitted and a rule shall be issued upon it and it shall thereafter be disposed of according to law there will be no order as to costs of the appeal\n",

      "ca no 450 of 1959\n",
      "the judgment was delivered by gajendragadkar j\n",
      "1  this appeal by special leave arises out of an industrial dispute between the appellant the punjab national bank ltd and the respondents its workmen on 17 june 1958 the central government referred his dispute for adjudication to the central industrial tribunal delhi constituted under s7a of the industrial disputes act xiv of 1947 this reference was made under s 101d of the said act the question referred for adjudication is thus stated in the order of reference \n",
      "whether the punjab national bank ltd delhi is justified in imposing a condition that the persons appointed as officers grade ii either by direct recruitment or by promotion shall be governed by the rules of the bank as applicable to officers in respect of scales of pay and other conditions of service and not by those of the award of the allindia industrial tribunal bank disputes as modified by s 3 of the industrial disputes banking companies decision act 1955 41 of 1955 and if not to what relief are such persons entitled\n",
      "2 the industrial tribunal heard both the parties considered the evidence led by them in support of their respective contentions and has made an award in favour of the respondents in dealing with the reference the tribunal framed two issues the first issue was whether the appellant was justified in issuing circular no 249 dated 18 april 1957 ex m 4 and thereby imposing the conditions contained therein on its employees and whether such a circular was opposed to law as contended by the respondents the second issue was whether in view of the subsequent circular no 336 ex m1 issued by the appellant on 26 may 1958 the respondents can have no grievance at all in the matter both these issues have been answered by the tribunal substantially in favour of the respondents the tribunal has held that though the appellant may be at liberty to impose and conditions it liked on new entrants in its service it could not impose any conditions in its preexisting staff which were inconsistent with the bank award which was then in operation that is why the tribunal has set aside the promotions made by the appellant from the existing employees to grade ii under the relevant circulars and directed the appellant to make promotions to the cadre of officer grade ii from among its employees according to the procedure prescribed by the said bank award\n",
      "3  it is against this award that the appellant has come to this court by special leavethe appellant which is an important banking company carries on its banking operations through its 350 odd branches situated all over the country it employs more than 7 000 workmen in its several offices in the present appeal we are concerned with its supervisory staff whose strength approximately is 824 as we will presently point out the present industrial dispute is the culmination of longstanding difference between the appellant and its supervisory staff and the story of these difference goes back to the constitution of the sen tribunal appointed in june 1949 this tribunal was called upon to deal inter alia with the problem of the supervisory staff employed by indian banks\n",
      "4 after an exhaustive enquiry it made its award but on an appeal to this court the said award was set aside in 1951 thereafter act 11 of 1951 was passed as a temporary measures for freezing certain provisions of the said award in order to prevent the spread of the prevailing unrest amongst the bank employees in question the said dispute was then referred by the central government to the sastri tribunal in january 1952 this tribunal held an elaborate enquiry and made its award which was published on 20 april 1953 appeals were preferred by the banks and their employees against the said award before the labour appellate tribunal and on 28 april 1954 the appellate tribunal substantially confirmed the recommendations and directions of the sastri tribunal with certain modifications in these arbitration proceedings 121 banks were concerned amongst them was the present appellant after the decision of the labour appellate tribunal was pronounced the central government made certain modifications in the said decision and that led to the appointment of a commission of enquiry on the five points referred to it on 25 july 1955 the commission submitted its report and in the terms of the said report the parliament passed act 41 of 1955 which was in operation for five years thereafter it is common ground that at the relevant time the decision of the labour appellate tribunal as modified by the later act governed the relations between the appellant and the respondents\n",
      "5 according to the respondents the appellant consistently followed a policy of refusing to implement the said decision and with that object it began to issue circulars with a view to persuade the respondents to give up their claims under the said decision the respondents however were determined to enforce their rights under the said decision and that led to arbitration proceedings between the parties the central government referred to mr rameshwar dayal for his adjudication a dispute relating to 17 supervisors accountants and head cashiers named in the reference the main point of controversy between the parties was whether the employees designated as aforesaid were workmen under the act or not whereas the respondents thought they were workmen the appellant denied it on 4 april 1957 the said tribunal decided this point in favour of the respondents and it held that the appellant was not justified in reissuing a dispute in that behalf it is in the background of this previous history of longstanding dispute that the subsequent events which led to the present reference have to be considered\n",
      "6 the sastri award which dealt exhaustively with all the items of dispute between the parties made several recommendations two of which may be specifically mentioned at this stage in para 164 the award provided that in regard to categories of employees specified in the said paragraph it was necessary that special allowances should be paid these categories were serially specified as categories 1 to 9 and in respect of each of them the special allowance fixed was prescribed by the award it is wellknown that the sastri award had classified the banks into four classes and the directions in regard to the payment of special allowance was made by reference to the areas where the said banks were operating the class of employees designated as supervisors superintendents subaccountants departmental incharges and employees in charge of treasury pay office constituted category 9 and a special allowance of rs 50 per month was payable by a class banks in regard to themparagraph 529 of the award dealt with the problem of promotions\n",
      "7 the award stated that it was not possible to lay down any hard and fast rule in connexion with promotions it rejected the suggestion of the employees unions that they should be consulted in connexion with promotions because it was satisfied that such suggestions were not supportable on principle it was agreed that promotion could not be treated as a matter which could be made automatic and a great deal of discretion by its very nature must rest with the management in that connexion even so in the said paragraph the award made certain general recommendations which may be borne in mind by the management in dealing with cases of promotion the award also deal with the problem of dearness allowance in different places readjustment of salaries office hours overtime wages procedure to be followed in taking disciplinary action and transfers in several paragraphs the respondents case is that the provisions contained in these several paragraphs of the award which were confirmed by the appellate decision were binding between the parties at the relevant time and it was not open to the appellant to impose any new condition into the contract of service which was inconsistent with any of the provision of the said decision that in substance is the basis of the grievance made by the respondents in the present proceedings\n",
      "8 let us now briefly indicate the nature and effect of the circulars issued by the appellant seeking to introduce new conditions of service governing the employment of the respondents the first circular in the series is circular no 201 issued on 8 august 1956 ex w 5 by this circular the appellant framed certain rules for promotion of clerks to the cadre of supervisors it appears that the rules framed by the appellant in that behalf were not exhaustive and so the said rules were revised and new elaborate provisions were made for promoting clerks to the cadre of supervisors these rules prescribe the allotment of marks under different clauses and are intended to held the management in assessing the quality of the work done by the employee with a view to decide whether he should be promoted to the cadre of supervisor or not this circular does not appear to be inconsistent with any provision of the award or decision and no serious exception can be taken on it\n",
      "9 the followed circular no 249 ex m 4 dated 18 april 1957 by this circular the appellant announced that its board of directors has sanctioned the creation of two grades for the officer staff officer grade ii with its pay scale beginning with rs 175 in the grade rs 17515325eb20425 and officer grade i beginning with rs 225 in the grade rs 22520425eb25550 the circular then proceeded to add that all existing confirmed supervisors shall be placed in grade ii and all confirmed officers of the rank of accountants and assistant managers in grade i according to the circular salaries of persons who were drawing less than the starting salary of the new grade should be raised to the minimum of the new grade from 1 april 1957 when the said grade had come into existence the circular further promised that adjustment allowance then being drawn by the officer shall be wiped off to the extent of increase in his employments on account of the revision of grades it appears that the tribunal was inclined to hold that this provision about adjustment allowance contravened the award but it has been fairly conceded before us that the said view is erroneous so that by itself this circular also cannot be said to contravene the award or the decision\n",
      "10 but there are two other confidential letters which were issued by the appellant along with the said circular and which lend strong support to the respondents case that the circular was issued as a part of a scheme whereby the appellant wanted to deprived the respondents of their legitimate rights under the award the first confidential letter issued on 30 may 1957 ex m 18 and addressed to the different branch managers starts by saying that according to industrial decisions the status of an employee has to be determined not by his designation but by reference to the nature of the work that he does this has reference to industrial decisions under s2s of the act then the circular says that the appellant was anxious to avoid such disputes and it adds \n",
      "accordingly it has been decided to address the supervisors and accountants working at your branch with a letter copy of which is attached you are requested to issue the aforesaid letter under you signatures to the supervisors and accountants working under you and send their replies to us in a confidential cover along with a complete list of duties performed by them as per specimen attached\n",
      "11 the other letter ex m 18a purports to enquire from the different employees whether they considered themselves as officers or workmen in other words the enquiry addressed to the employees was on the question as to whether they claimed the status of a workman under s2s of the act or not in case the employee agreed that he was an officer then the appellant agreed to place him in the two scales mentioned by circular no 249 and the letter significantly adds that if the employee is thus promoted to either of the two officer grades\n",
      "the bank rules shall apply to your regarding the various benefits and conditions of service\n",
      "the last sentence in the letter is also significant it says \n",
      " should you however consider that in view of the nature of most of your duties you should be considered as workman covered under the sastri award you should please let us know so that we may ascertain your duties and decide your status\n",
      "12 in other words this letter clearly and unambiguously shows that it is only if an employee agreed to be treated as an officer that he stood any chance of promotion to either of the two grades if he claimed the status of a workman then the bank reserved to itself he liberty to decide that matter for itself since these two letters were sent to the different branch managers before giving effect to the two grades announced by circular no 249 it is obvious that the said circular and the two letters formed part of the same transaction and the statement in the said circular that all existing confirmed supervisors shall be placed in grade ii became an empty promise only such supervisors were confirmed as agreed to treat themselves as officers and those who claimed the status of workman were not confirmedit appeared that after the employees were sounded by sending the two confidential letters the appellant decided to take the next step and so it issued circular no 292 ex w 2 on 13 december 1957\n",
      "13 this circular refers to the earlier circular no 201 of 8 august 1956 and says that the appellant had decided to fill up future vacancies of officers grade ii in bihar orissa assam madhya pradesh rajasthan and places in bombay state outside bombay city and so it wanted to call for applications from clerical staff having 10 marks or more in the priority list according to educational qualifications length of service better start and special increments the circular closed with the positive statement that on appointment to such posts the employees will be governed by the bank rules as applicable to officer staff in respect of service conditions scales of pay transfers etc and not those of the bank award thus the result of this circular is clear that employees promoted to the class of officers in grade ii would be deprived of the benefits of the bank award and would be governed by the bank scales in other words what the earlier circular indirectly attempted to do with the assistance of the two confidential letters was directly sought to be done by this circular no doubt the circular ostensibly was limited to the appointments mentioned in the branches specified in it but the object of the circular cannot be concealed by the specification of such branches the appellant had decided to recruit to grade ii only such employees as would forgo their status as workmen and would be willing to take bank scales and nothing more\n",
      "14 the circular naturally led to dissatisfaction amongst the employees who began to make loud protest against this open contravention of the bank award as a result of the protests thus made by the employees the present reference was made on 17 june 1958 a few days before this reference was made the appellant thought it fit to modify its impugned circular and with that object it issued another circular no 336 ex m 1 on 26 may 1958 this circular says that some employees may not have applied for promotion due to the impugned clause in the earlier circular of 13 december 1957 no 292 and it called upon them to apply for consideration of their cases on merits the circular added that should any one of them be selected for promotion he would be given an option either to elect for the award scales of pay and allowances or to be governed by the bank rules applicable to officers\n",
      "15 that in brief is the nature of the circulars which have given rise to the present disputethe first question which has been urged before us by mr veda vyas on behalf of the appellant is that the reference itself is invalid his argument is that as the words used in the reference stand they indicate that it is only persons who have been promoted subject to the impugned condition whose cases are referred to adjudication and he points out that none of such persons has raised any dispute and therefore no industrial dispute could have been referred for adjudication at all this argument proceeds on the assumption that the first part of the reference refers to persons appointed subject to the impugned condition but in our opinion this assumption is clearly not justified\n",
      "16 the question referred has no reference to the persons appointed subject to the impugned conditions but it refers to the question as to whether the impugned condition itself is valid or not in other words the reference can be paraphrased thus  is the condition that the person appointed to officer grade ii by promotion would be governed by the rules of the bank valid and justified  this is the only way in which the reference can be read that being so we do not think that there is any substance in the challenge to the validity of the reference\n",
      "17 the next argument is that the award made by the tribunal is outside its jurisdiction because relief granted by the award covers persons other than those who have been promoted to grade ii this contention is also based on the same misconstruction of the terms of reference it assumes that the reference is confined to persons who have been promoted and so it seeks to limit the scope of the reference as to relief to the same class of persons if on the other hand the reference is in regard to the validity of the conditions sought to be imposed by the impugned circular then the nature and extent of the relief would also be similarly extended\n",
      "18 mr veda vyas has then relied on the fact that the tribunal itself has held in favour of the appellant that fresh appointments of new recruits can be made by the appellant subject to any terms it deems reasonable to impose and he argues that in introducing the impugned condition the appellant really wanted to benefit its employees by making them eligible for promotion to grade ii he has also contended that the tribunal was in error in attributing to the appellant a wellplanned scheme by which the appellant intended to deprive the respondents of the arrears of special allowance to which they were entitled under the award how can any scheme however cleverly designed deprive the respondents of their arrears which may have accrued in their favour under the award asks mr veda vyas\n",
      "19 prima facie this point appears to be attractive but when we scrutinize the two confidential letters carefully it becomes plain that the whole object of the enquiry instituted by the said letters was to obtain an admission from the employees about their status before the promised promotion came their way in other words if the employees answered the query as the appellant expected them to do and said they were officers having regard to the nature of their duties then the said admission would itself put the said employees outside the protection of the award and in that sense they would not be entitled to make any claim for the arrears of any special allowance that at any rate must have been the object with which the confidential letter was issued in this connexion it would be material to recall that the dayal award was pronounced on 4 april 1957 and circular no 249 innocent in appearance was issued on 18 april 1957 coupled with the two confidential letters\n",
      "20 we are satisfied that the tribunal was right in taking the view that the object of issuing the circulars and two letters was to persuade or tempt the employees to make an admission that they were not workmen under the act and thus disqualify them from making any claim for special allowance guaranteed to them under the award if that be the true position then the argument that the circular was intended to benefit the employees and put them on a par with new recruits cannot claim even prima facie the merit of plausibility the next contention raised is that whatever may be the infirmity in the circulars nos 249 and 292 that has now become a matter of history because of a fresh circular no 336 issued on 26 may 1958 this circular called upon the employees who were unwilling to forgo the award to apply for promotion and it solemnly promised them that in case they were selected they would be given an option either to remain under the award or to choose the banks scale indeed mr veda vyas suggested that in view of the last circular no industrial dispute could be said to subsist between the parties at the date of the reference\n",
      "21 in our opinion this contention is not willfounded it is obvious that this last circular was issued because it was apprehended by the appellant that the protests made by the employees were likely to succeed and that an industrial dispute was likely to be raised it is with a view to prepare its defense for meeting the employees case before the tribunal that this circular was issued by the appellant and so if any prejudice has been caused to the respondents by the earlier circulars it cannot be said that they have been rectified or cured merely by the issue of this latter circularbesides there can be no doubt that after the original circular was issued on 18 april 1957 many promotions have been made and they have been made in most cases only in regard to persons who agreed to give up their claims under the award in this process prejudice must have been caused to a large number of employees who stood by the award and did not accept the tempting offer of promotion for a price the price being in their opinion too heavy to be paid to illustrate the nature of prejudice which must have been caused to a large number of employees some oral evidence was led on behalf of the respondents kashyap goyal gupta and others have given evidence on oath that they were not promoted and their juniors were promoted solely for the reason that they stood by the award whereas their juniors submitted to the condition imposed by the appellant this oral evidence shows that officers in charge of branches expressly told the employees that the appellant had decided to promote only those who would take the bank scales and give up the benefits under the award he evidence has not been challenged by any statement on oath on behalf of the appellant and it has been believed by the tribunal therefore the conclusion of the tribunal that prejudice was caused to a large number of employees by the impugned circulars of 18 april 1957 and 13 december 1957 cannot be successfully challenged\n",
      "22 there is one more point which must be considered in this connexion mr veda vyas argues that whatever may be said against circular no 292 there is no reason why the earlier circular no 249 should be brought into the controversy he has urged a similar argument in regard to the earliest circular no 201 issued on 8 august 1956 in regard to circular no 249 it is impossible to accept the argument that it is either innocent or is not connected with the scheme evolved by the appellant for the purpose of depriving the respondents of their legitimate rights under the award we have already observed that by itself the circular reads like an innocent circular but the two confidential letters issued along with it clearly bring out the object underlying the said circular\n",
      "23 in fact what was contained in the confidential accompaniments of the said circular ultimately became a part of the subsequent circular therefore it is not possible to dissociate the said circular from the main impugned circular no 292 three circulars nos 249 292 and 336 form part of the same scheme and transaction and they are held together by the invisible thread of the two confidential letters therefore in our opinion the tribunal was right in holding that the last circular did not mitigate the impropriety or remove the illegality of the two earlier circulars and that the said two circulars contravened the respondents right under the awardthe position in regard to circular no 201 issued on 5 august 1956 is however different it is no doubt possible to contend that this circular was the beginning of the scheme but on the other hand prior to the issue of this circular promotion rested entirely in the discretion of the management and if by this circular the management revised its earlier rules and made elaborate provisions for the allotment of marks it would be difficult to hold that this circular by itself contravened any of the rights vesting in the respondents by virtue of the award or that it was really a part of the same transaction evidenced by subsequent circulars at the hearing before us a statement has been filed on behalf of the appellant which shows the promotions that have taken place during the relevant period\n",
      "24 sixtyeight promotions were made to the cadre of supervisors between 8 august 1956 and 18 april 1957 it is admitted that though the circular of 18 april 1957 had affirmed that all confirmed supervisors would be placed in officer grade ii in actual fact only 451 out of 542 affirmed supervisors were originally placed in the said cadre obviously because the remaining supervisors did not accept the appellants scale and conditions therefore up to 13 december 1957 promotions to grade ii numbered 128 and promotions to supervisors cadre numbered 7 similarly from 13 december 1957 to 4 october 1958 the two respective promotions are 210 and 5 it has been fairly conceded before us by the learned attorneygeneral on behalf of the respondents that he cannot seriously question the propriety of the 68 promotions to the grade of supervisors that took place between 8 august 1956 and 18 april 1957 in regard to the remaining categories of promotions they are clearly open to challenge because while these promotions were made obviously cases of other persons who were eligible at that time were not considered because they did not agree to take the bank rates and scales\n",
      "25 we would therefore confirm the finding of the tribunal that circular no 249 read with the two confidential letters and circular no 292 have contravened the rights of the respondents under the award and as such are invalid we would also confirm the finding of the tribunal and its conclusion that the promotions made from 18 april 1957 by virtue of the said circulars and bad and must be set aside there are however two directions issued by the award of the tribunal which must be reversed and they are in regard to circular no 201 issued on 8 august 1956 and the direction issued by the tribunal to the appellant to promote such of the respondents as are eligible to the cadre of officer grade ii\n",
      "26 it is conceded that the said cadre is not a matter of right conferred on the respondents by the award and all that the respondents can claim is to have their wages structure allowances and promotions in the ordinary way as prescribed by the award if however the appellant wants to continue the said cadre it must take care to see the promotion to the said cadre does not depend on any conditions prejudicial to or inconsistent with the employees rights under the award subject to the said modifications the award of the tribunal is confirmed and the appeal is dismissed there will be no order as to costs\n",

      "43 drawing our attention to the affidavit filed by shri jagmohan dalmia in slp c no 2236122363 of 2004 the learned counsel would contend that he claimed to be continuing as chairman both de facto and de jure\n",
      "44  according to learned counsel good faith is at the core of the function of a body like the board the election was to be held at the end of the meeting and having regard to the fact that the meeting had been adjourned an odd situation has come into being viz that the elected board cannot function and mr dalmiya continues to be the president of the board so long he is not elected as patroninchief according to the learned counsel malafide on the part of the president of the board is apparent inasmuch as he wanted confirmation of his own invitation as patroninchief before the process of election was completed\n",
      "45  mr nariman pointed out that in the special leave petition no statement as to what had happened on 29th september 2004 regarding election of the office bearers of the board had been made but the same had been disclosed only in an additional affidavit filed in the slp of mca\n",
      "46 drawing our attention to the fact that mr agashe after having been debarred from attending the annual general meeting made a representation on 29th september 2004 itself to the president of the board asking for reasons as regard his disqualification to participate in the meeting on behalf of maharashtra cricket association but he refused to accept the representation and in that situation it had to be ultimately served on the secretary of the board but no reply thereto has yet been received either by mr agashe or by maharashtra cricket association\n",
      "47  the learned counsel would contend that although a resolution was passed in the meeting of the maharashtra cricket association in favour of mr agashe but he was not allowed to participate and if the agm of the board was to be adjourned this item could also have been adjourned\n",
      "48 drawing our attention to the additional affidavit filed on 20th october 2004 wherein a special pleading has been made that at the annual general meeting an opportunity of hearing had been given allegedly to both mr agashe and mr thorve it was contended that the same was wholly unnatural and thus gives rise to another controversy\n",
      "49  the learned counsel would contend that mr thorve in his letter dated 10th april 2004 took a positive stand that mr agashe should not be permitted to represent the maharashtra cricket association but he was permitted to do so by mr dalmia as would appear from his letter dated dated 3rd may2004 purported to be upon obtaining legal opinion stated\n",
      "your letter dated 10 april 2004 addressed to our board was forwarded for legal opinion\n",
      "according to the legal opinion received the orders of the high court as well as the apex court were restricted to the affairs of mca only and not bcci under the order of the apex court the mca shall not undertake any policy decision until disposal of the appeal by the district court\n",
      "the legal opinion further states that the restriction on taking any policy decision by the maharashtra cricket association has nothing to do with representing the association in the meetings of the board even if any policy decision is taken by the board through its working committee it shall be the policy of bcci and not mca\n",
      "50  mr nariman would contend that the legal opinion received by the board which having regard to the tenor of the said letter dated 3rd may 2004 evidently was a written one has designedly been withheld from this court it is thus evident that there exists two contrary opinions whereupon the board had relied upon in two different situations it was contended that there was no reason as to why mr jagmohan dalmia himself did not affirm any affidavit in this regard clarifying his position\n",
      "51  mr nariman would submit that the fact that in a similar situation rajasthan cricket association was permitted to be represented in agm proves malafide on the part of the board\n",
      "52  the learned counsel had also drawn our attention to the letter of mr bg deshmukh one of the observers appointed by the bombay high court and submitted that neither he could raise any objection as regard requisitioning of the meeting nor could he have forwarded his letter to mr ajay b shirke and mr sg thorve on the ground that they had asked for the copy of his letter for being placed before the mca such an act on the part of mrdeshmukh mr nariman would contend was improper particularly when the said addressees had no concern with the said notice and more so when the same was received by them even before the service thereof on the maharashtra cricket association our attention was also drawn to the counteraffidavit filed by the respondent no 1 wherein it has been alleged\n",
      "it is pertinent to state that the said observer resides in pune and the meeting was also to be held in pune itself and inspite of notice being served on him he does not attend the meeting it is also submitted that no objection as to the appointment of mr dc agashe to represent maharashtra cricket association has been raised by the said observer it is also peculiar that mrsg thorve and mr ajay b shirke who had no concern with the said notice was also given a copy even before the same could be received by maharashtra cricket association the deponent also wishes to point out that mr rg deshmukh the learned observer is the chairman of one of the companies owned by mr ajay b shirke\n",
      "53  it was submitted that if the representation of maharashtra cricket association through mr agashe in the earlier meetings of the board had not been a policy decision of maharashtra cricket association then why all of a sudden it became so for the agm only\n",
      "54  drawing our attention to the affidavit of mr agashe filed in slp no 2182021822 of 2004 the learned counsel would submit that the chairman of the board in the meeting firstly created an artificial right for casting one vote as chairman and then exercised his right of casting vote again ie voting twice which was in contravention of the rules\n",
      "55  in terms of rule 3 there are 30 full members and in terms of rule 5 only full members have right to vote the chairman of the board is not a member as he does not represent an association it was pointed out that it is not necessary that the president of the board would be the chairman of the meeting and in that view of the matter rules 25 26 and 27 must be construed in such a manner so as to hold that the chairman of a meeting cannot vote twice but only once in any event the learned counsel would contend that in a case of this nature the chairman ought not to have exercised his discretionary power to cast vote twice\n",
      "56  mr nariman would draw our attention to the judges summons in oa no 803 of 2004 wherein the following prayers were made\n",
      "1 this honble court should not be pleased to treat the application as ugent\n",
      "2 why this honble court should not be pleased to pass an order of adinterim injunction to restrain the chairman oblique president of bcci from conducting the annual general meeting on the 29th and 30th of september 2004 at kolkata and direct that the said meeting be conducted under the chairmanship of any person or persons of the stature of a retired supreme court judge or high court judge or any other person or persons as to be named by this honble court with absolute powers to scrutinize and approve the list of authorized representatives from member associations eligible to vote in the said annual general meeting of the 1st respondent\n",
      "57  our attention has further been drawn to the order dated 2892004 passed by the learned single judge of the madras high court in oa no 803 of 2004 and oa no 804 of 2004 relevant paragraph whereof is as under\n",
      " the third respondent is further prohibited from disqualifying any member of bcci and prevent them from voting\n",
      "58  the learned counsel would point out that the division bench in its order had referred to the order dated 2892004 passed by the learned single judge even otherwise in the memo of appeal no ground was taken questioning the said order of injunction as contained in the order passed by the learned single judge\n",
      "59  mr nariman would further submit that the undertaking given by a senior counsel must be construed in the light of the understanding of the learned judges before whom the same had been given across the bar and in this connection our attention has been drawn to the impugned order as noticed supra\n",
      "60  in this regard our attention has also been drawn to the 4th question raised in the slp filed by the board which is in the following terms\n",
      "iv whether the honble high court was right in concluding that the learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners herein gave an undertaking to the effect that no one would be disqualified from voting despite the fact that the actual undertaking given by the learned counsel to the effect that no one would be disqualified on the ground of zonal representation to contest the election\n",
      "61  our attention has also been drawn to the ground b of the special leave petition which is to the following extent\n",
      " it is submitted that the learned high court had erred in coming to the conclusion that the undertaking given by the learned senior counsel had been violated when in fact no such undertaking was given by the learned senior counsel it is submitted that the undertaking given by the learned senior counsel was duly recorded in the order dated 29092004 passed by the self same learned division bench it is submitted that the learned senior counsel who earlier appeared on 29092004 also appeared on 08102004 before the learned bench and expressly recorded the submissions that were made by him on 29092004 and contended that there was no reason as to why such a question had not been raised before the division bench itself\n",
      "62 according to mr nariman the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the board before the madras high court has not filed any affidavit as regard tenor of his undertaking and in this view of the matter the statement of the judge in the impugned order should be accepted mr harish salve learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of netaji would submit that the board is a federal head of cricket associations having regard to the evolution of sports of cricket in this country and in particular the fact that the board controls the sport in india a higher standard of rectitude in the affairs of the board is expected mr salve would submit that in an annual general meeting of the board the aspirations of an individual member could not have been given priority having regard to the fact that the board does not have private member it was argued that even the rajasthan cricket association was not registered and time had been taken to get it registered but despite the same it was allowed to vote but maharashtra cricket association was not permitted although the board knew that litigations have been going on not only in relation to the maharashtra cricket association but also in relation to the rajasthan cricket association and delhi  district cricket association and thus in a situation of this nature the chairman ought to have acted judiciously\n",
      "63  relying on a decision of this court in k murugan vs fencing association of india jabalpur and others 1991 2 scc 412 1991 indlaw sc 543 mr salve would argue that even therein a retired judge of this court was nominated so long a valid election was not made only with a view to see that the body like the olympic association or the board must act in the interest of the sports of the country\n",
      "64  as regard exercise of right of casting vote by mr dalmia the learned counsel would contend that the same could be exercised when there was a genuine tie and not an artificial or a created one election of the office bearers of the board according to mr salve should not only be a fair one but must be appear to be such it was argued that the adjournment of the agm was illegal and what happened on 29th september 2004 was far below the standard of conduct expected from a body like the board and furthermore the manner in which the meeting was conducted clearly creates an air of suspicion\n",
      "65  as regard functioning of the board it was urged that the same being based on trust the power and abuse would bring into focus administrative law situation reliance in this behalf has been placed on nagle vs feilden and others 1966 2 qb 633 at 643 and 644 and st johnstone football club limited vs scottish football association 1965 slt 171\n",
      "66  mr salve would argue that the chairman of the meeting should have acted as an umpire having regard to the role of the board as a federal association and keeping in view the mandate of rule 5 in terms whereof only 30 full members could exercise their right of franchise according to mr salve keeping in view the larger public interest the technicality of absence of the elected members in these proceedings should not stand in the way of this court declaring the election void particularly in view of the fact that all the elected members have knowledge of the proceedings but are sitting on the fence\n",
      "67  dr singhvi in reply would draw our attention to the prayer for an interim order by netaji in the review application ie for restraining the newly elected body which according to the learned counsel would mean that the old body had ceased to continue and pursuant to or in furtherance of the said prayer only the impugned order of injunction was passed by the division bench\n",
      "68  as regard the agm held on 2992004 it was contended that some of the items of agenda particularly item nos 1c and 2 to 6 were taken up and they were considered and resolutions thereupon were passed further on 3092004 some other items of agenda were taken up but item nos 1b and 13 could not have been taken up in view of the order of injunction passed by the district court of madras according to the learned counsel by reason of such adjournment of the meeting mr dalmia did not derive any benefit inasmuch as his nomination as representative of the board to icc could have been passed in that agm and in any event even without such resolution he would have continued to act as a representative before the said body\n",
      "69  the learned counsel would contend that the meeting was adjourned with concurrence of all the participants present in the meeting and with no opposition according to dr singhvi the only persons who have been taking objections were netaji or bharathi who are not even the members of the board and could not have participated in the election process\n",
      "70  as regard the power of the chairman to cast two votes the learned counsel would submit that the rules envisage casting of votes by president only and not by any other member as would appear from the rules 5 and 25 of the rules rule 26 provides that the decision taken by the majority shall prevail except in case of equality of votes when casting of vote may be necessary by the chairman by reason of first part of rule 27 dr singhvi would contend no diminution of power is contemplated inasmuch as by reason thereof the right of the chairman to exercise his right as regards casting vote is preserved and the expression subject to rules must be held to mean subject to rule 26 dr singhvi would contend that having regard to the precedent as two votes had been cast by the chairman even earlier the rule should be interpreted in the same way as was understood by all concerned he would argue that the subject matter of voting contained in rules 25 and 27 contemplate two different situations as the context in which rule 25 is attracted is radically different from rule 27\n",
      "71  the rule of harmonious construction according to dr singhvi should be applied in a situation of this nature inasmuch as if rule 27 is held to be subject to rule 5 the first part thereof shall become nugatory pointing out the difference between rule 26 and rule 27 it was argued that whereas rule 26 applies for all meetings rule 27 applies only to annual general and special general meeting\n",
      "72 according to dr singhvi having regard to rule 431c of the rules an election dispute should be raised in terms thereof and in a case of this nature the court should not entertain any election dispute when there exists an alternative remedy\n",
      "73  dr singhvi would argue that when there exists substantive laws governing resolution of dispute in relation to election of office bearers of the board this court should not exercise its jurisdiction uart 142 of the constitution\n",
      "74  mr ss ray learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of mr jagmohan dalmia would submit that right of casting vote is not a common law right but one granted by the statute the provision for exercise of right of casting vote is essentially for maintaining a status quo which in the cases of clubs and associations should be construed to be the second vote\n",
      "75  the learned counsel would contend that in the meeting dated 2992004 no member had been disqualified but in absence of any authorized member to represent it nobody could cast vote on its behalf keeping in view the fact that the board has nothing to do with the internal dispute of the maharashtra cricket association this court should not interfere in the matter particularly when even in the next meeting a similar problem may arise distinguishing the decision of this court in k murugan 1991 indlaw sc 543 supra the learned counsel would contend that the factual matrix obtaining therein was different and in the present case there is no allegation of mismanagement malfunctioning or maladministration nor any allegation has been made against mr dalmia\n",
      "76  when the matter was listed before this court on 11102004 this court was given an impression that having regard to the fact that the election of the office bearers of the board had already taken place on 2992004 the new board had taken over an impression was also created that if the board was not allowed to function a stalemate would ensue particularly having regard to the proposed test series and one dayers which were to be played between south africa and india and one day cricket between india and pakistan the impugned order appointing the administrator by the division bench of the madras high court it was submitted if allowed to continue would thus be detrimental to the interest of the sport of cricket\n",
      "77 it was in this situation this court stayed the operation of the impugned order to the extent of appointment of administrator however a different picture was presented before us at the hearing stating that the new board had not taken over at all and the old board had been functioning purported in terms of rule 20iii of the rules thus in law the old board could continue the appellants were not seriously prejudiced and in any event no emergent situation arose as had been projected before this court\n",
      "78  the board is a society registered under the tamil nadu societies registration act it enjoys a monopoly status as regard regulation of the sport of cricket in terms of its memorandum of association and articles of association it controls the sport of cricket and lays down the law therefor it inter alia enjoys benefits by way of tax exemption and right to use stadia at nominal annual rent it earns a huge revenue not only by selling tickets to the viewers but also selling right to exhibit films live on tv and broadcasting the same ordinarily its full members are the state associations except association of indian universities railway sports control board and services sports control board as a member of icc it represents the country in the international foras it exercises enormous public functions it has the authority to select players umpires and officials to represent the country in the international fora it exercises total control over the players umpires and other officers the rules of the board clearly demonstrate that without its recognition no competitive cricket can be hosted either within or outside the country its control over the sport of competitive cricket is deep pervasive and complete\n",
      "79  in law there cannot be any dispute that having regard to the enormity of power exercised by it the board is bound to follow the doctrine of fairness and good faith in all its activities having regard to the fact that it has to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of millions it has a duty to act reasonably it cannot act arbitrarily whimsically or capriciously as the board controls the profession of cricketers its actions are required to be judged and viewed by higher standards\n",
      "80 an association or a club which has framed its rules are bound thereby the strict implementation of such rules is imperative necessarily the office bearers in terms of the memorandum and articles of association must not only act within the fourcorners thereof but exercise their respective powers in an honest and fair manner keeping in view the public good as also the welfare of the sport of cricket it is therefore wholly undesirable that a body incharge of controlling the sport of cricket should involve in litigations completely losing sight of the objectives of the society it is furthermore unfortunate that a room for suspicion has been created that all its dealings are not fair the board has been accused of shady dealings and double standards\n",
      "81  we have noticed the contentions raised by the parties herein at some length not because they were absolutely necessary for the purpose of arriving at a decision but with a view to show that the rival contentions necessitate a deeper probe and scrutiny unfortunately for the reasons stated hereinafter we are at this stage not in a position to do so and leave the contentions wide open to be agitated by the parties before the appropriate forums\n",
      "82  on 11th october 2004 we had after hearing the counsel for the parties observed that if a situation arises this court would go into the validity of the election of the office bearers of the board held in the meeting dated 29th september 2004 but as indicated hereinbefore we did so under a mistaken belief that the board would be represented by the new office bearers and thus all parties would be before us however it now stands admitted that the office bearers either in their personal capacity or official capacity are not before us\n",
      "83 they may have notice of the pendency of this proceeding they may be sitting on the fence and watching the proceedings of this court but unless they are made parties in these proceedings we would not be in a position to entertain the dispute as regard validity of the meeting of 29th september 2004 resulting in the election of the office bearers giving an opportunity of hearing to the elected members in a dispute of this nature is imperative and not a matter of mere procedure formality or technicality the election dispute therefore must be adjudicated upon by a proper forum\n",
      "84  the events leading to these appeals as narrated hereinbefore raise a abysmal picture and a sordid state of affairs\n",
      "85  in the suit filed by netaji two interim applications were filed being oa no 803 and oa no 804 of 2004 indisputably in oa no 803 of 2004 the court granted an order of injunction restraining the board from disqualifying any members of the board and preventing them from voting although in the memo of appeal filed by the board before the division bench of the madras high court against the said order the orders passed both in oa nos 803 and 804 of 2004 were sought to be questioned no ground in relation thereto appears to have been raised in the memo of appeal in relation to the said order of injunction and no argument appears to have been advanced before the division bench in that behalf the division bench of the high court while passing the order on 29th september 2004 noticed the order of the learned single judge dated 28th september 2004 but its attention probably was not drawn to relevant paragraph thereof\n",
      "86 even the attention of the division bench to the said effect does not appear to have been drawn by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the plaintiff respondent no 1 herein had the intention of the division bench specifically been drawn to the said order of injunction we are sure that the learned judges would have dealt with it specifically however in law the said order of injunction did not subsist as the suit itself was withdrawn with the consent of the parties and both the appeal and the suit were disposed of by the order dated 2992004 however whether the suit itself could have been withdrawn and disposed of by the division bench in purported exercise of its power under subs 2 of s 107 of the code as well as on the basis of the determination of the learned judges is open to question we are also not aware as to whether the original side rules of the madras high court contemplate such a situation\n",
      "87  indisputably an undertaking had been given by a learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the board in the impugned order the division bench before whom such undertaking had been given was of the opinion that it was misled this court having regard to the understanding of such undertaking by the division bench does not intend to deal with the effect and purport thereof and as we are of the opinion that the division bench of the madras high court itself is competent therefor if the order of the learned single judge is to be taken into consideration it is possible to contend that the learned judges of the high court were correct\n",
      "88  we are furthermore of the opinion that the jurisdiction of the high court in entertaining a review application cannot be said to be ex facie bad in law s 114 of the code empowers a court to review its order if the conditions precedents laid down therein are satisfied the substantive provision of law does not prescribe any limitation on the power of the court except those which are expressly provided in s 114 of the code in terms whereof it is empowered to make such order as it thinks fit\n",
      "89  order 47 rule 1 of the code provides for filing an application for review such an application for review would be maintainable not only upon discovery of a new and important piece of evidence or when there exists an error apparent on the face of the record but also if the same is necessitated on account of some mistake or for any other sufficient reason\n",
      "thus a mistake on the part of the court which would include a mistake in the nature of the undertaking may also call for a review of the order an application for review would also be maintainable if there exists sufficient reason therefor what would constitute sufficient reason would depend on the facts and circumstances of the case the words sufficient reason in order 47 rule 1 of the code is wide enough to include a misconception of fact or law by a court or even an advocate an application for review may be necessitated by way of invoking the doctrine actus curiae neminem gravabit\n",
      "90  it is true that in moran mar basselios catholicos and another vs the most rev mar poulose athanasius and others 1955 1 scr 520 1954 indlaw sc 131 this court made observations as regard limitations in the application of review of its order stating \n",
      "before going into the merits of the case it is as well to bear in mind the scope of the application for review which has given rise to the present appeal it is needless to emphasise that the scope of an application for review is much more restricted than that of an appeal under the provisions in the travancore code of civil procedure which is similar in terms to order xlvii rule 1 of our code of civil procedure 1908 the court of review has only a limited jurisdiction circumscribed by the definitive limits fixed by the language used therein it may allow a review on three specified grounds namely i discovery of new and important matter or evidence which after the exercise of due diligence was not within the applicants knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed ii mistake or error apparent on the face of the record and iii for any other sufficient reason it has been held by the judicial committee that the words any other sufficient reason must mean a reason sufficient on grounds at least analogous to those specified in the rule\n",
      "but the said rule is not universal\n",
      "91  yet again in lily thomas 2000 indlaw sc 325 supra this court has laid down the law in the following terms\n",
      "52 the dictionary meaning of the word review is the act of looking offer something again with a view to correction or improvement it cannot be denied that the review is the creation of a statute this court in patel narshi thakershi v pradyumansinghji arjunsinghji air 1970 sc 1273 1970 indlaw sc 553 held that the power of review is not an inherent power it must be conferred by law either specifically or by necessary implication the review is also not an appeal in disguise it cannot be denied that justice is a virtue which transcends all barriers and the rules or procedures or technicalities of law cannot stand in the way of administration of justice law has to bend before justice if the court finds that the error pointed out in the review petition was under a mistake and the earlier judgment would not have been passed but for erroneous assumption which in fact did not exist and its perpetration shall result in miscarriage of justice nothing would preclude the court from rectifying the error \n",
      "92  it is also not correct to contend that the court while exercising its review jurisdiction in any situation whatsoever cannot take into consideration a subsequent event in a case of this nature when the court accepts its own mistake in understanding the nature and purport of the undertaking given by the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the board and its correlation with as to what transpired in the agm of the board held on 29th september 2004 the subsequent event may be taken into consideration by the court for the purpose of rectifying its own mistake\n",
      "93  in rajesh d darbar and others vs narasingrao krishnaji kulkarni  ors 2003 7 scc 219 2003 indlaw sc 593 this court noticed 4 the impact of subsequent happenings may now be spelt out first its bearing on the right of action second on the nature of the relief and third on its importance to create or destroy substantive rights where the nature of the relief as originally sought has become obsolete or unserviceable or a new form of relief will be more efficacious on account of developments subsequent to the suit or even during the appellate stage it is but fair that the relief is moulded varied or reshaped in the light of updated facts patterson v state of alabama 1934 294 us 600 illustrates this position it is important that the party claiming the relief or change of relief must have the same right from which either the first or the modified remedy may flow subsequent events in the course of the case cannot be constitutive of substantive rights enforceable in that very litigation except in a narrow category later spelt out but may influence the equitable jurisdiction to mould reliefs conversely where rights have already vested in a party they cannot be nullified or negated by subsequent events save where there is a change in the law and it is made applicable at any stage lachmeshwar prasad v keshwar lal air 1941 fc 5 falls in this category courts of justice may when the compelling equities of a case oblige them shape reliefs  cannot deny rights  to make them justly relevant in the updated circumstances\n",
      "94 where the relief is discretionary courts may exercise this jurisdiction to avoid injustice likewise where the right to the remedy depends under the statute itself on the presence or absence of certain basic facts at the time the relief is to be ultimately granted the court even in appeal can take note of such supervening facts with fundamental impact this courts judgment in pasupuleti venkateswarlu v motor  general traders air 1975 sc 1409 1975 indlaw sc 408 read in its statutory setting falls in this category where a cause of action is deficient but later events have made up the deficiency the court may in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation permit amendment and continue the proceeding provided no prejudice is caused to the other side all these are done only in exceptional situations and just cannot be done if the statute on which the legal proceeding is based inhibits by its scheme or otherwise such change in cause of action or relief the primary concern of the court is to implement the justice of the legislation rights vested by virtue of a statute cannot be divested by this equitable doctrine  see vprv chockalingam chetty v seethai ache air 1927 pc 252\n",
      "95  furthermore the impugned order is interlocutory in nature the order is not wholly without jurisdiction so as to warrant interference of this court at this stage the division bench of the high court had jurisdiction to admit the review application and examine the contention as to whether it can have a relook over the matter this court it is trite ordinarily would not interfere with an interlocutory order admitting a review petition the contentions raised before us as regard the justification or otherwise of the division bench exercising its power of review can be raised before it furthermore the court having regard to cl ii of its order dated 2992004 may have to consider as to whether the election was held in accordance with theconstitution of the board and the rules and byelaws framed by it\n",
      "96  the conduct of the board furthermore is not above board the manner in which the board had acted leaves much to desire\n",
      "97  the question as to whether the maharashtra cricket association has unjustly been deprived of its right to participate in the agm through mr agashe whereas ddca and the rajasthan cricket association had been allowed to participate therein is a question which would require deeper probe and a detailed scrutiny\n",
      "98  the board had not filed even legal opinion which it obtained before replying to mr thorves letter dated 10th april 2004 the tenor of the boards letter dated 3rd may 2004 clearly demonstrates that a written opinion was obtained as therein the following expressions have been used\n",

      "99  in the said legal opinion a distinction appears to have been made between a policy decision to be taken by maharashtra cricket association visvis representation of the association in the meetings of the board no distinction might have been drawn therein as regard different types of meetings of the board viz extraordinary general meeting and annual general meeting or any other meeting nor do we find any a person may either be entitled to represent an association or he is not a persons right to represent an association ordinarily would not vary with the nature of the meeting unless otherwise provided in the statute so far no satisfactory explanation has been furnished as to why another legal opinion was sought for and acted upon in preference to the first one\n",
      "100  one of the question is whether mr agashe could have represented the maharashtra cricket association in terms of resolution dated 27092004 different standards cannot be adopted by the board viz one for the purpose of requisitioned meeting for inviting mr dalmia to become the patroninchief of the board and other for the purpose of attending an agm in other meetings maharashtra cricket association had admittedly been represented by mr agashe it is also doubtful as to whether the board could have gone into if at all the validity or otherwise of the meeting of the maharashtra cricket association held on 27th september 2004 it is also a matter of contention as to whether mr deshmukh had exceeded his jurisdiction not only in taking his stand as contained in his letter dated 27th september 2004 but also sending copies thereof to mr thorve and mr ajay b shirke before it was received by the maharashtra cricket association\n",
      "101  mr deshmukh in terms of the order of the bombay high court prima facie was merely to attend the meeting and give his approval or withhold it as regard any policy decision which may be taken whether sending a representative of the maharashtra cricket association is a matter of policy warranting interference by the observers appointed by the bombay high court is again a contentious issue the members of the association could not have undermined the importance of electing its representative for the ensuing annual general meeting of the board\n",
      "102  the maharashtra cricket association itself has filed a special leave petition questioning the order of the division bench of the madras high court dated 29th september 2004 in a situation of this nature this court may not exercise its jurisdiction uart 136 of the constitution of india because the order impugned before it is not correct the jurisdiction of this court uart 136 of the constitution is a discretionary one\n",

      "6 what are the options before us obviously as a logical corollary to our finding we have to interfere with the judgment of the high court because the view taken by it is not in conformity with the law it is at this stage that mr sanghi learned counsel for the respondent invited us to consider the humanitarian aspect of the matter the submission is that the jurisdiction of this court uart 136 of the constitution is discretionary and therefore this court is not bound to tilt at every approach found not in consonance or conformity with law but the interference may have a deleterious effect on the parties involved in the dispute laws cannot be interpreted and enforced divorced from their effect on human beings for whom the laws are meant undoubtedly rule of law must prevail but as is often said rule of law must run akin to rule of life and life of law is not logic but experience by pointing out the error which according to us crept into the high courts judgment the legal position is restored and the rule of law has been ensured its prestine glory having performed that duty under art 136 is it obligatory on this court to take the matter to its logical end so that while the law will affirm its element of certainty the equity may stand massacred there comes in the element of discretion which this court enjoys in exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction under art 136 \n",

      "yet again in ram chandra singh vs savitri devi and others 2003 8 scc 319 2003 indlaw sc 842 this court observed\n",

      "the courts can take notice of the subsequent events and can mould the relief accordingly but there is a rider to these well established principles this can be done only in exceptional circumstances some of which have been highlighted above this equitable principle cannot however stand in the way of the court adjudicating the rights already vested by a statute this well settled position need not detain us when the second point urged by the appellants is focused there can be no quarrel with the proposition as noted by the high court that a party cannot be made to suffer on account of an act of the court there is a well recognised maxim of equity namely actus curiae neminem gravabit which means an act of the court shall prejudice no man this maxim is founded upon justice and good sense which serves a safe and certain guide for the administration of law the other maxim is lex non cogit ad impossibilia ie the law does not compel a man to do that what he cannot possibly perform\n",

      "31 we have on the premises aforementioned no hesitation to hold that the decision of the council of ministers was ex facie irrational whereas the decision of the governor was not in a situation of this nature the writ court while exercising its jurisdiction uart 226 of the constitution as also this court uarts 136 and 142 of the constitution can pass an appropriate order which would do complete justice to the parties the high court unfortunately failed to consider this aspect of the matter\n",
      "however keeping in view of the fact that the elected office bearers are yet to take over charge with a view to do complete justice to the parties we would in exercise of our jurisdiction uart 142 of the constitution direct that the adjourned meeting should immediately be convened as regard the election of the office bearers of the board it would further be open to an aggrieved party to question the legality or validity of the said meeting dated 29th september 2004 netaji also may if it is otherwise permissible in law subject to an appropriate order that may be passed by the madras high court may file an application for amendment of the plaint or take such other step or steps as it may be advised\n",
      "108  keeping in view of the fact that on 8th october 2004 when the impugned order was passed the new board had not taken over as also having regard to the prayer made in the interim application filed by netaji for grant of interim injunction restraining the newly elected board from functioning in the interim we make our interim order dated 11th october 2004 staying the operation of the part of the order whereby mr justice s mohan was appointed as an interim administrator absolute leaving the parties to file such interim applications as may be necessary in the changed situation\n",
      "however keeping in view of the fact that interim order of injunction as regard agenda item nos 1b and 13 been passed by a district court at chennai the suit filed by bharathi cricket club we are of the opinion that it is not necessary to pass any other order at this stage as regard invitation to mr jagmohan dalmia to become the patroninchief of the board\n",
      "109  we are however of the opinion that it would not be appropriate to restore the order of the learned single judge dated 2892004 as was submitted by mr nariman as the purpose for which mr justice s mohan was appointed has lost its efficacy\n",
      "110  in view of the orders passed by us we do not think it necessary to pass separate orders in the special leave petition filed by the maharashtra cricket association the maharashtra cricket association shall however be at liberty to file an appropriate application for getting itself impleaded in the proceedings pending before the madras high court subject to any objection that may be taken by the board we however furthermore are of the opinion that keeping in view the facts and circumstances of this case that part of the order of the division bench dated 29th september 2004 whereby and whereunder the board was directed to pay a further sum of rs 1 lakh to mr justice s mohan as additional remuneration cannot be sustained it is set aside accordingly\n",
      "111  keeping in view the peculiar fact situation obtaining herein we would request the high court to consider the desirability of disposing of the matters pending before it as expeditiously as possible\n",
